<p>"A practical mathematician, who has quickness to seize a

these scantlings. It is extremely probable, that Savery took

it is considered that some of the contrivances apparently not
the least abstruse, have, by close application been found to
answer all that the Marquis says of them, and that the first

given in that work, it is unnecessary to enlarge on the utility

MARQUIS OF WORCESTER.
</p>

<p>There are few persons who have suffered
more from party zeal, or gained less from
historic candour, than the noble subject of
the following brief memoir. Indeed no
regular biographer has yet appeared to do
justice to his zealous exertions in the cause
of his unfortunate but misguided master, or
his still more patriotic efforts for the advancement
of scientific knowledge. All, however,
who have in any shape alluded, either to
the political principles, religious tenets, or
scientific acquirements of the Marquis of
Worcester, appear to have been guided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
rather by a spirit of fanatic intolerance, or a
wish to clear King Charles from the heavy
responsibility which attached to instructions
given under his own hand and seal, when
the Marquis was employed in Ireland. These
then appear to have been the concurring
causes, that have so long withheld from the
noble Author the veneration his memory so
justly merits; and we now proceed to follow
him through his short but active career in
public life.</p>

<p>Edward, sixth earl and second Marquis
of Worcester, was born at Ragland near
Monmouth; and his family, who had long
been distinguished for the most devoted
loyalty, possessed the largest landed estate
of any nobleman attached to the British
court. His grandfather Edward, fourth Earl
of Worcester, enjoyed in a most distinguished
degree the favour of Queen Elizabeth,
and her successor King James. In
1593, he was instituted Knight of the Garter,
and received a pension of fifteen hundred
pounds per annum for life. Sandford describes
him as "a great favourer of learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and good literature:" he died in the 79th
year of his age, at Worcester House, in the
Strand; and was buried in Ragland church.</p>

<p>Henry, the fifth earl, and father of the
Marquis, succeeded to the title and estates
in 1628: the family revenue derived from
those in Monmouthshire alone, at this period
amounting to upwards of twenty-thousand
pounds per annum. In 1642, the year in
which he was created Marquis of Worcester,
he raised and supported an army of 1500
foot, and near 500 horse-soldiers, which were
placed under the command of his son Lord
Herbert, the subject of this Memoir.</p>

<p>During the civil commotions, Charles
made several visits to Ragland castle, where
he was entertained with the greatest magnificence,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and on those occasions particularly
distinguished the young Lord Herbert.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
On an open rupture taking place between
the King and Parliament, his Majesty invested
Lord Herbert with the command of
a large body of troops then raising in his
native country, and an opportunity was soon
offered for calling his military talents into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
action. Prince Rupert, shortly after the
battle of <i>Marston Moor</i>, directed his attention
towards the Marches of Wales, which
awakening the jealousy of the Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
General Massey, he by a feigned counter-movement
surprised the city of Monmouth,
which had always been considered as the key
of South Wales, and thus threw the inhabitants
of Ragland into the greatest confusion
and alarm.</p>

<p>On the first intelligence of the fall of
Monmouth reaching the Marquis, he despatched
Lord Herbert with a considerable
body of forces, who joining a troop of cavaliers
from Godridge, lodged themselves undiscovered
behind a rising ground near that
city. A party of about forty men, who
volunteered for the occasion, were headed
by Lord Herbert, and proceeded to reconnoitre
the town. Having climbed an earthen
redoubt which had been thrown up by the
Parliamentary forces, they passed the ditch
and fell upon the guard, who were immediately
put to the sword, and a few seconds
more sufficed for breaking the <em>port-chain</em>
and forcing an entry for the horse, who,
having by this time joined their brave comrades,
entered the town at full gallop; surrounding
the main guard, the whole of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
they took prisoners. The result of this
brilliant and chivalrous enterprise was the
capture of Colonel Broughton, four captains,
as many lieutenants and ensigns, the committee,
all the private soldiers, and a considerable
quantity of arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>So signal a display of bravery and devotedness
to the royal cause in the young
cavalier procured from his Majesty the
warmest commendations; and in the month
of January, 1644, he had the honour to
receive his first commission to negotiate
with the Irish Catholics; while at the same
time he was recommended by the king to
the Earl of Ormonde, as one whose loyalty
might be relied upon. With regard to his
<em>Lordship's</em> fitness for this appointment, there
can be but one opinion: educated among
Catholics, and as such not likely to excite
the same suspicions as would naturally attach
to any negotiation with their avowed enemy,
the Earl of Ormonde, and possessing considerable
influence at the court of Rome, he
seemed peculiarly qualified to fill the office
of mediator; and having become popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
with the people at home by his known liberality
and patriotism, the appointment was
not likely to excite much dissatisfaction on
the part of the Puritans.</p>

<p>The deranged state of his Majesty's affairs,
which were now growing desperate from the
continued advantages of the rebels in Ireland,
and his still more violent and fanatic
subjects at home, rendered it necessary
that some sacrifices should be made to conciliate
the Irish Catholics; as he would
thus procure a powerful and efficient force
to aid him against the Covenanters. In
proof of his anxiety on this subject, there
were no less than eight letters written by
the king himself, beside those of his secretaries,
pressing for a speedy adjustment of
the differences that had so long agitated the
sister kingdom.</p>

<p>The first commission under the great seal
was dated the sixth of January, and furnished
the Marquis with full power to levy any
number of men in Ireland or elsewhere; to
make governors of forts, &amp;c.; and to receive
the king's rents. Upon the twelfth of March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
following, the Marquis received another
commission, equally as extensive as the preceding;
a copy of which is preserved by
Rushworth, in his Collections, which we here
subjoin.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles</span>, by the grace of God, of
England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, &amp;c., to our trusty
and well beloved cousin, <span class="smcap">Edward</span> Earl of
Glamorgan, greeting. We, reposing great
and especial trust and confidence in your
approved wisdom and fidelity, do by these
presents, as firmly as under our Great Seal,
to all intents and purposes, authorise, and
give you power to treat and conclude with
the confederate Roman Catholics in our
kingdom of Ireland, if upon necessity any
be to be conscended unto, wherein our lieutenant
(the Earl of Ormonde) cannot so well
be seen in, as also not fit for us at present
publicly to own. Therefore we charge you
to proceed according to this our warrant
with all possible secrecy; and for whatsoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
you shall engage yourself, upon such
valuable considerations as you in your judgment
shall deem fit, we promise, upon the
word of a king and a Christian, to ratify and
perform, the same that shall be granted by
you and under your hand and seal; the said
confederate Catholics having by their supplies
testified their zeal to our service: and this
shall be in each particular to you a sufficient
warrant.</p>

<p>"Given at our Court at Oxford, under
our Signet and Royal Signature, the twelfth
of March, in the twentieth year of our reign,
sixteen hundred and forty-five."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>
<p>Who, it may be asked after perusing this
document, will be hardy enough to pronounce
with Hume that "the king was incapable
of dissimulation?" especially when
coupled with his Majesty's subsequent declaration
to both Houses of Parliament; in
which he expressly says, that the Marquis,
having made an offer to raise forces in Ireland
and conduct them into England for his
service, had a commission to that purpose;
"but then," adds the king, "it was to that
purpose only, and not to treat of any thing
else without the privity and direction of the
Lord Lieutenant."</p>

<p>What degree of credit ought to be given
to the latter part of his Majesty's declaration,
is pretty plainly shewn by the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
letter to the papal legate, which fully
accords with the instrument we have just
quoted of the twelfth of March:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Hearing of your resolution for Ireland,
we do not doubt but things will go well,
and that the good intentions began by means
of the last pope, will be accomplished by the
present, by your means in our kingdoms of
Ireland and England, you joining with our
dear cousin the Earl of <span class="smcap">Glamorgan</span>; with
whom whatever you shall resolve we shall
think ourselves obliged to, and perform it at
his return. His great merits oblige us to
this confidence, which we repose in him
above all, having known him above twenty
years; during which time, he hath always
signally advanced himself in our good esteem,
and by all kind of means carried the prize
above all our subjects. This being joined
to the consideration of his blood, you may
well judge of the passion which we have
particularly for him, and that nothing shall
be wanting on our part to perfect what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
shall oblige himself to in our name, in consideration
of the favours received by your
means. Confide therefore in him: but in
the meanwhile, according to the directions
we have given him, how important it is that
the affair should be kept secret, there is no
occasion to persuade you, since you see that
the necessity of the thing requires it. This
is the first letter which we have ever wrote
immediately to any Minister of State of the
Pope, hoping it will not be the last; but
that after the said earl and you shall have
concerted your measures, we shall openly
shew ourself, as we have assured him.</p>

<p class="sig">
Your Friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p>
<i>From our Court at Oxford,<br />
30th April, 1645.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The earl's negotiation had hitherto gone
on prosperously, and there was good reason
to suppose that he would shortly have
brought the rebels to a complete concurrence
with his Majesty's views, when a most
unexpected accident disconcerted the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of his schemes. An attempt having been
made by the Irish upon Kilkenny about the
end of October, 1645, in which the titular
Archbishop of Tuam had a command; the
rebels were beaten and the prelate killed, in
whose baggage was found a copy of the
treaty which his Lordship had entered into
with the confederate Catholics and the pope's
nuncio. Of this discovery immediate information
was furnished to the Parliament,
then sitting, which had invariably expressed
the greatest aversion to any concession being
made to the Catholics; and the matter became
so public, that the Lords Ormonde
and Digby found it necessary to do something
towards the vindication of his Majesty's
honour, and to preserve appearances with
the Parliament.</p>

<p>The council having met on the twenty-sixth,
Lord Digby appeared at the board,
and accusing the Earl of Glamorgan of high
treason, moved that he should be immediately
committed to the castle. On the
following day he was examined by a committee
of the council, when he exonerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
his Majesty, and requested that the whole
blame of the matter might be attributed to
him; as he had consulted with no one on
the subject, but the parties with whom he
had made the agreement.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When the intelligence of his lordship's
imprisonment reached Kilkenny, where the
supreme council then held their sittings, the
Catholics were thrown into the greatest
confusion, and some insisted on an immediate
recourse to arms for his enlargement.
These proceedings, however, were soon
stayed by the friends of the Earl of Ormonde,
and his lordship was shortly afterwards released<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
on bail. As soon as this was effected
he repaired to Kilkenny, in order to expedite
the embarkation of a force amounting
to about three thousand men, which had
been raised for the relief of Chester; and,
had there been a sufficient co-operation on
the part of the general council, they might
have sailed time enough to have afforded
the most essential service to the royal cause;
but after repeated delays on their part, intelligence
was brought of the loss of that
important city; and the Marquis, finding
that his further stay in Ireland was attended
with considerable hazard to his own life,
without any commensurate benefit to his
Majesty, resolved on embarking for France,
where he was soon after joined by the exiled
queen.</p>

<p>Immediately after his lordship's departure
for the continent, the parliamentary
forces under Sir Thomas Fairfax appeared
before Ragland; and being refused admission
by the venerable old Marquis, their
hostile approaches were carried on with
great vigour, in spite of repeated sallies from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
the fortress. The gallant veteran, however,
finding the garrison, which at first consisted
of only 800 men, reduced to less than half
that number, surrendered on honourable
terms on the 17th August. Notwithstanding
the pledge given by Sir Thomas Fairfax,
the conditions of capitulation were most disgracefully
violated, and the Marquis was
committed to the custody of the Black Rod,
where he languished till the December
following; when he expired in the eighty-fifth
year of his age, and was buried in St.
George's Chapel at Windsor.</p>

<p>In the mean time the fortifications of Ragland
were destroyed, and all the timber in
the parks was cut down, and sold by the
committee of sequestrations. The lead alone
that covered the castle was sold for 6,000
pounds, and the loss to the family in the
house and woods, has been estimated at not
less than 100,000 pounds!</p>

<p>From the destruction of Ragland castle
by the Parliamentary forces, till the beginning
of 1654, the earl's name scarcely occurs
in the political history of those times; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
about that period, we find him attached to
the suit of Charles II., who then resided at
the court of France: and in the following
year he was dispatched by the exiled monarch
to London, for the purpose of procuring
private intelligence and supplies of
money, of which the king was in the greatest
need. He was, however, speedily discovered
and committed a close prisoner to the Tower,
where he remained in captivity for several
years.</p>

<p>Some idea of the state of indigence to
which the Marquis was now reduced may
be formed from a perusal of the following
Letter, directed to the celebrated Colonel
Copley, who was, it appears, one of the noble
Author's supporters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dear Friend,</p>

<p>"I knowe not with what face to

yet payed you the five pownds, and the

</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>On the king's restoration, the Marquis of
Worcester was one of the first to congratulate
his Majesty on the happy event, though
the situation of the unfortunate nobleman
was little bettered by the change; indeed it
appeared but as the signal for new persecutions,
as one of the earliest public acts of
that ungrateful monarch may be characterized
as an invidious attempt to set aside the
just claims of his earliest and best friend.</p>

<p>In 1660 the House of Lords appointed a
committee to consider of the validity of a
patent granted to the Marquis of Worcester
in prejudice to the Peers, upon the first intimation
of which his Lordship sent a messenger
to the committee then sitting, stating
his willingness to surrender it, and it was
shortly afterwards presented to the House
by his son Lord Herbert.</p>

<p>In 1663 appeared the first edition of the
noble Author's Century of Inventions, and
on the 3d of April in the same year, a bill
was brought in for granting to him and his

<p>Of the merits of the <cite>Century of Inventions</cite>

with justice be said; whether, however, as

<p>The Marquis likewise published a work
entitled "An Exact and true Definition of the
most stupendous Water-commanding Engine,
invented by the Right Honourable (and deservedly
to be praised and admired) Edward
Somerset Lord Marquis of Worcester, and
by his Lordship himself presented to his most
excellent Majesty Charles II., our most
gracious Sovereign." This was published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
in a small quarto volume consisting of only
twenty-two pages, and is now become extremely
rare.</p>

<p>His lordship survived the publication of
this work but two years; as he died in retirement
near London upon the third of April
1667. His remains were conveyed with
funeral solemnity to the cemetery of the
Beaufort family in Ragland church; where
he was interred on Friday the nineteenth of
the same month, near the body of his grandfather,
Edward Earl of Worcester. The
coffin was placed in an arched stone vault,
with the following inscription on a brass
plate:</p>

<p>"Depositum Illustrissimi Principis Edwardi
Marchionis et Comitis Wigorniæ,
Comitis de Glamorgan, Baronis Herbert de
Raglan, Chepstow et Gower, nec non serenissimo

King for any money businesse euen in your

secondly that as for Creations you had
absolutely promised his Ma<sup>tie</sup> you would not
importune him againe, to the furst I answeare
that this is to save the Kings Coffirs, since
certainely if eyther honor or conscience
should take place his Ma<sup>tie</sup> ought to saue
me harmelesse from the six thousand pound
Confest and proued to be y<sup>e</sup> Crownes Debt,
soe happyly now vpon his Head by your

y<sup>r</sup> Graces part is to minde his

not say disgust his good subiects well desarueing
yet that as far as loyalty and Religion
will giue them leaue, and I am sory his

my Lord Chancellor was pleased to

soe will y<sup>e</sup> King too in graunting of

refused to pay three hundered pound

five thousand pound to rayse the first Regiment

<p>I did not thinke I should have had
the occation to have troubled you with an
other Letter but I am soe little sattisfyed
with yours in what I required conscerninge
my monyes that I cannot thinke a survilous
paper an equal ballance for soe waighty and
iust a debt: I confesse I have hard of a new
way to pay ould debts but certainly this is
the newest, I belieue your Ladiship is one
of the first that euer tryd it: itt may bee <i>al a
mode</i>, but truely I doe not like the fashion,
though itt may bee others doe: To answare
your Letter, first for your Religion I medle
not with itt It conscerns not mee; if I have,
certainely I have done rather an hon<sup>r</sup> to itt
then an iniury: for I belieu'd soe well of
your Religion that itt tought noe man to
distroy his faith, Hon<sup>r</sup>, and Christianety;
which my Lord hath done in his engagement
to mee I onely speake of him&mdash;I pray you
Maddam lett mee aske, what is hon<sup>r</sup> if
broken? tis easely answared noe hon<sup>r</sup>, what
is itt to pretend a faith in Jesus Christ, to be
call'd a Christian, and to breake that faith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
and likewise forfitt that Christianety, he's
noe Christian and whereas you say I wronge
the memory of the late Kinge (I know
not upon what grounds) Maddam you doe
mee wronge, I serve the memory of that
Royall Martyr, equall to any hee that lives:
I pray you did his Ma<sup>tie</sup> euer engage his
faith, hon<sup>r</sup>, and Christianety, to pay any
debts, where in he fail'd; Maddam vnder
fauour I must say you doe his incomparable
ashes iniury. You likewise tell mee noe
gallant pearson wilbeleiue but that my Lord
will pay mee when hee hath itt, tis a large
extent, and for ought I know may reach to
Dooms day; tis small sattisfaction to expect
a certaine debt att such an vncertaine payment.
Maddam you haue the priueledge
of a Woeman in speakinge of my Loyalty,
noe man can, nor dare tax itt, for my publishinge
any thinge that conscernes your
Lord, tis his owne actions that causeth mee
to report those truths: You say my Lord
hath spent more in his Ma<sup>ties</sup> seruice than
any Protestant, I dare say there has beine
ten thousand loyall faithfull Protestants hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
spent as much: where of I am one, for wee
have spent, and lost all wee had to our proportions,
tis as much as hee (the widowes
mite will make itt good) and in soe doinge
wee did but our dutyes, and wee ought not
to obraide the King with itt, tis vnhandsome
to expect Sallery for a lawfull duty. Your
Ladyship saith that I reported my Lord
gaue mee counterfitt plates, I confesse hee
gaue mee some plates, and forced them upon
mee, hee likewise borrowed them of mee
againe, resoluinge to returne them within
too dayes, but he hath not restored them to
this day, I heare since that my Lord hath
sould them: I hope hee will confesse that
noe man of Hon<sup>r</sup> did euer such an action
before, allthough he was ready to starue,
and for his giuinge mee false plate, I must
deny itt for I neuer said itt, but this I did
say, that when I was at his Lordsp's house
he showed mee some plates, that was not
the same that hee had formerly giuen mee
for the first was beaten, and the latter was
cast, if that was counterfitt, I sayd itt, and
that ile iustify. for your friuolous paper, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
dare say your reconcil'd iudgment doth repent
the sendinge of itt, I have shewed it to
diuers of your religion, and they condemne
you for itt, likewise the paper, nor can the
Kinge of Englande giue you thanks for itt.
But his royall Mother beinge a Roman
Catholique, my hon<sup>r</sup> and admiration of her
doth silence my penn in answeringe that
scandalous paper.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="smcap">Noble Madam</span>&mdash;<br />
<br />
The Grace of the Holy-ghost be with you.
</p>

<p>The great esteeme and honour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>w<sup>ch</sup> I have euer had for your Ladys<sup>p</sup> hath
all waise made mee prompt and willing to
serve you to the best of my power, without
the bias of selfe interest, as your selfe can
witnesse; And because I feare that at present,
your Honour hath noe one, that in the
greate concernes, which you have in hand,
will tell you the truth, as it often happens to
persons of greate quality: I have thought it
the part of my Priestly function, and fidelity
towards yo<sup>r</sup> Ho<sup>r</sup>: (haveing first in my poore
prayers, humbly commended it to Alm: God)
to represent unto you, that w<sup>ch</sup> all your
friends know to bee true, as well as myselfe,
and would be willing that your Ladys<sup>p</sup> should
know it likewise.</p>

<p>Alm: God hath Madam put you into a
happy, and flourishing condition, fitt and
able to serue God, and to doe much good
to your selfe and others; and your Ladys<sup>p</sup>
makes yourselfe unhappy, by seeming not to
be contented with your condition but troubling
your spiritts with many thoughts of
attayning to greater dignityes and riches.</p>

<p>Madam all those that wish you well, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>greeued to see your Ladys<sup>p</sup> to bee allready
soe much disturbed &amp; weakened in your
iudgment &amp; in danger to loose the right use
of your reason, if you doe not tymely endeauour
to preuent it, by ceasing to goe on
with such high designes, as you are vppon,
which I declare to you, in the faith of a
Priest to bee true: The cause of your present
distemper, and of the aforesayd danger,
is doubtlesse, that your thoughts and imagination
are very much fixed on the title of
Plantagenet, and of disposing yourselfe for
that greate dignity by getting of greate sums
of money from the king, to pay your deceased
Lords debts, and enriching your selfe by the
great Machine and the like. Now Madam
how vnproper such undertakings are for
your L. and how vnpossible for you to effect
them, or any one of them, all your friends
can tell you if they please to discover the
trueth to you.</p>

<p>The ill effects that flow from hence are
many: as the danger of looseing your health
and iudgment by such violent application of
your fancies in such high designes and ambitious
desires; the probability of offending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>
Alm: God and preiudising your owne soule
thereby: the advantage you may thereby
give to those who desire to make a prey of
your fortune, and to rayse themselves by
ruining of you: the spending greate sums of
money in rich and sumptuous things w<sup>ch</sup> are
not suteable to the gravity of your Ladys<sup>p</sup>
and present condition of Widdow-hoode
and mourning for your deceased Lord.</p>

<p>Although it bee certine, that it is a greate
temptation which you are now vnder, and
very dangerous and hurtfull both to your
temporall and eternall happynesse; yet I
confesse that the Devil, to make his suggestion
the more preualent, doth make vse of
some motives that seeme plausible, as of paying
your Lords debts, of founding of monasterys,
and the like, and that your Ladys<sup>p</sup>
hath the Kings favour to carry on your
designes. But Madam it is certine that
the King is offended with your comeing to
the Court, and much more with your pretention
to the title of Plantaginet; and it is dangerous
to provoke him any farther: And for
paying of Debts and founding of Monasteryes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>
wee all know that your L. can neuer
bee in a better condition to doe it, than now
you are; and as you are not bound to doe
such things, so they are not expected from
you; but wee all applaud your pious inclinations
herein, of w<sup>ch</sup> you will not loose the
merit with Alm: God but our apprehensions
are, least you should by your Ladys<sup>ps</sup> inordinate
designes bring your selfe into such a
condition, as not to bee able to helpe your
friends nor your selfe.</p>

<p>Bee pleased Madam now to give mee
leave to suggest some waie how the approaching
dangers may bee prevented, by
changing the objects of your affections, and
insteede of temporall, to seeke after eternall
riches, and honors, which your age doth
assure you are not far off; for w<sup>ch</sup> you may
dispose yourselfe, before death comes, by
retiring into the countrey for some time,
from the distractions of the Court, where
you may haue the advice and directions of
some learned Priest, in whose vertue you
may wholey confide, and bee guided by him,
for your internall quiet &amp; security. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
places may soone be found out, that are fitt
for that purpose: At Hammersmith Mrs.
Bedingfield a very vertuous &amp; discreete person,
and of your Ladys<sup>ps</sup> acquaintance, hath
lately taken a faire house &amp; garden, &amp; hath
but a small family. In some such place your
Ho<sup>r</sup> might likewise haue the aduice of some
well experienced Doctor, for the health of
your person, and the benefitt of good ayre
and of quietnesse, would much conduce to
your health: And soe by Alm. Gods blessing,
you may recouer from that most pernicious
distemper of bodey and mind, vnto w<sup>ch</sup> every
one seese you to bee very neere approching,
and may live many yeares with your owne
fortune &amp; dignity in greate honour and happynesse
&amp; bee the author of many good
workes of piety &amp; Charity to the glory of
God &amp; eternall saluation of your owne soule.
Thus dear Madam I have ventured to declare
a great trueth to you, w<sup>ch</sup> was before
a secrett only to your selfe. I know that I
run the hazerd of incurring your displeasure,
if your Ladys<sup>p</sup> should not reade the candor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>of my intentions, w<sup>ch</sup> in my Letter I intend
towards you: but my assurance of haveing
herein performed a duty w<sup>ch</sup> I owe to my
God, and the hope I have that you will take
it well as I intend it, have encouraged mee
to doe it, and to subscribe myselfe</p>

THE<br />

<span class="b12">LORDS SPIRITUAL AND TEMPORAL</span>;<br />

AND TO<br />

THE KNIGHTS, CITIZENS, AND BURGESSES<br />

OF THE<br />

<span class="b12">HONOURABLE HOUSE OF COMMONS</span>:<br />

NOW ASSEMBLED IN PARLIAMENT.</p>


<p>MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</p>

<p>Be not startled if I address to all,
and every of you, this Century of Summary
Heads of Wonderful Things, even after the
dedication of them to his most excellent
Majesty, since it is with his most gracious
and particular consent, as well as indeed no
ways derogating from my duty to his sacred
self, but rather in further order unto it,
since your Lordships, who are his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span>
Council, and you, Gentlemen, his whole kingdom's
Representatives (most worthily welcome
unto him) may fitly receive into your
wise and serious considerations, what doth
or may publicly concern both his Majesty
and his tenderly-beloved people.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if I say, (my Lords and Gentlemen)
that it is jointly your parts to digest
to his hand, these ensuing particulars, fitting
them to his palate, and ordering how
to reduce them into practice, in a way useful
and beneficial, both to his Majesty and
his kingdom.</p>

<p>Neither do I esteem it less proper for me
to present them to you in order to his Majesty's
service, than it is to give into the
hands of a faithful and provident steward,
whatsoever dainties and provisions are intended
for the master's diet; the knowing
and faithful steward being best able to make
use thereof to his master's contentment,
and greatest profit, keeping for the morrow
whatever should be overplus or needless for
the present day, or at least to save something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span>
else in lieu thereof. In a word, (my
Lords and Gentlemen,) I humbly conceive,
this simile not improper, since you are his
Majesty's provident stewards, into whose
hands I commit myself, with all properties
fit to obey you; that is to say, with a heart
harbouring no ambition, but an endless aim
to serve my King and Country: and if my
endeavours prove effectual, (as I am confident
they will,) his Majesty shall not only
become rich, but his people likewise, as
treasurers unto him; and his peerless Majesty,
our King, shall become both beloved
at home, and feared abroad; deeming the
riches of a King to consist in the plenty enjoyed
by his people.</p>

<p>And the way to render him to be feared
abroad, is to content his people at home,
who then with heart and hand are ready to
assist him; and whatsoever God blesseth
me with to contribute towards the increase
of his revenues, in any considerable way, I
desire it may be imployed to the use of his
people; that is, for the taking off such taxes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span>
or burthens from them as they chiefly groan
under, and by a temporary necessity only imposed
on them; which being thus supplied,
will certainly best content the King, and satisfy
his people; which, I dare say, is the
continual tend of all your indefatigable pains,
and the perfect demonstrations of your zeal
to his Majesty, and an evidence that the
kingdom's trust is justly and deservedly reposed
in you. And if ever Parliament acquitted
themselves thereof, it is this of yours,
composed of most deserving and qualified
persons; qualified, I say, with your affection
to your Prince, and with a tenderness to his
people; with a bountiful heart towards him,
yet a frugality in their behalfs.</p>

<p>Go on therefore chearfully (my Lords and
Gentlemen) and not only our gracious King,
but the King of Kings will reward you, the
prayers of the people will attend you, and
his Majesty will with thankful arms embrace
you. And be pleased to make use of me
and my endeavours to enrich them, not myself;
such being my only request unto you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span>
spare me not in what your wisdoms shall
find me useful, who do esteem myself not
only by the act of the Water-commanding
Engine (which so chearfully you have past)
sufficiently rewarded, but likewise with courage
enabled to do ten times more for the
future; and my debts being paid, and a competency
to live according to my birth and
quality settled, the rest shall I dedicate to
the service of our King and Country by your
disposals: and esteem me not the more, or
rather any more, by what is past, but what's
to come; professing really from my heart,
that my intentions are to outgo the six or
seven hundred thousand pounds already sacrificed,
if countenanced and encouraged by
you, ingenuously confessing, that the melancholy
which hath lately seized upon me (the
cause whereof none of you but may easily
guess) hath, I dare say, retarded more advantages
to the public service than modesty
will permit me to utter: and now, revived by
your promising favours, I shall infallibly be
enabled thereunto in the experiments extant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span>
and comprised under these heads, practicable
with my directions by the unparalleled
workman both for trust and skill, Caspar
Kaltoff's hand, who hath been these five and
thirty years as in a school under me employed,
and still at my disposal, in a place
by my great expences made fit for public
service, yet lately like to be taken from me,
and consequently from the service of King
and kingdom, without the least regard of
above ten thousand pounds expended by
me, and through my zeal to the common
good; my zeal, I say, a field large enough
for you (my Lords and Gentlemen) to work
upon.</p>

<p>The treasures buried under these heads,
both for war, peace, and pleasure, being inexhaustible;
I beseech you pardon me if I
say so; it seems a vanity, but comprehends
a truth; since no good spring but becomes
the more plentiful by how much more it is
drawn; and the spinner to weave his web
is never stinted, but further inforced.</p>

<p>The more then that you shall be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span>
to make use of my Inventions, the more inventive
shall you ever find me, one invention
begetting still another, and more and more
improving my ability to serve my King and
you; and as to my heartiness therein there
needs no addition, nor to my readiness a
spur. And therefore (my Lords and Gentlemen)
be pleased to begin, and desist not
from commanding me, till I flag in my obedience
and endeavours to serve my King and
Country:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For certainly you'l find me breathless first t'expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before my hands grow weary, or my legs do tire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet abstracting from any interest of my
own, but as a fellow-subject and compatriot
will I ever labour in the vineyard, most
heartily and readily obeying the least summons
from you, by putting faithfully in execution,
what your judgments shall think fit
to pitch upon amongst this Century of Experiments,
perhaps dearly purchased by me,
but now frankly and gratis offered to you.
Since my heart (methinks) cannot be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span>
in serving my King and Country, if it
should cost them any thing: as I confess
when I had the honour to be near so obliging
a master as his late Majesty of happy memory,
who never refused me his ear to any
reasonable motion: and as for unreasonable
ones, or such as were not fitting for him to
grant, I would rather to have died a thousand
deaths, than ever to have made any
one unto him.</p>

<p>Yet whatever I was so happy as to obtain
for any deserving person, my pains, breath
and interest imployed therein satisfied me
not, unless I likewise satisfied the fees; but
that was in my golden age.</p>

<p>And even now, though my ability and
means are shortened, the world knows why
my heart remains still the same; and be
you pleased (my Lords and Gentlemen) to
rest most assured, that the very complacency
that I shall take in the executing your commands,
shall be unto me a sufficient and an
abundantly-satisfactory reward.</p>

<p>Vouchsafe therefore to dispose freely of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span>
me, and whatever lieth in my power to perform;
first, in order to his Majesty's service;
secondly, for the good and advantage of the
Kingdom; thirdly, to all your satisfactions,
for particular profit and pleasure to your
individual selves, professing that in all and
each of the three respects I will ever demean
myself as it best becomes,</p>

<p class="center">THE<br />

MARQUIS OF WORCESTER'S<br />

<span class="b15">CENTURY OF INVENTIONS,</span><br />

EXPLAINED AND ILLUSTRATED.</p>


<h2>No. I.</h2>

<p>Several sorts of seals, some showing by
screws, others by gauges, fastening or unfastening
all the marks at once: others, by
additional points and imaginary places, proportionable
to ordinary escutcheons and
seals at arms, each way palpably and punctually
setting down (yet private from all
others, but the owner, and by his assent) the
day of the month, the day of the week, the
month of the year, the year of our Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the names of the witnesses, and the individual
place where any thing was sealed,
though in ten thousand several places, together
with the very number of lines contained
in a contract, whereby falsification may be
discovered, and manifestly proved, being
upon good grounds suspected.</p>

<p>Upon any of these seals a man may keep
accounts of receipts and disbursements, from
one farthing to an hundred millions, punctually
showing each pound, shilling, penny,
or farthing.</p>

<p>By these seals, likewise, any letter, though
written but in English, may be read and understood
in eight several languages; and in
English itself, to clear contrary and different
sense, unknown to any but the correspondent,
and not to be read or understood by
him neither, if opened before it arrive unto
him; so that neither threats, nor hopes of
reward, can make him reveal the secret, the
letter having been intercepted, and first
opened by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The use of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sigili</i> or "autograph seals" is very
ancient, indeed we find them mentioned by the
prophet Jeremiah (chap. xxii. v. 10); these,
however, were invariably engraved on the collets
or stones of rings, and it was not till a much
later date that hand stamps were applied to that
purpose. In England, the first sealed charter
extant is that of Edward the Confessor, upon his
founding Westminster Abbey; and many of our
English kings used them, from an inability to
affix any other kind of signature: this indeed is
candidly acknowledged by Caedwalla, a Saxon
king, who says, at the conclusion of one of his
charters, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propriâ manu pro ignorantiâ literarum
signum sanctæ crucis expressi et subscripsi</i>."</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a <em>corresponding seal</em>
that occurs prior to the sixteenth century, is that
described in a decree of Cardinal Otto, who was
papal legate in 1237, by which the bishops were
to bear on their seals their title, office, dignity,
and even their proper names. About this period
<em>mottos</em> were likewise generally introduced, but
none of those before the publication of the noble
author's work were at all adapted for secret correspondence;
or, in fact, had they any mode of
combining moveable characters in the matrix for
the purpose of varying the impression. The principle
upon which those described by the Marquis
must have been formed is simply this: a frame
similar to those in which seals are generally
mounted having been first prepared, a number of
moveable circles may be made to slide within each
other on one common centre. If three are employed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
they should be engraved with the numerals,
the alphabet, and, if intended for secret writing,
the third circle may be furnished with any
arbitrary signs that may suggest themselves.
These, by means of a key, of which both the corresponding
parties must possess a duplicate, may
be combined to form the day of the week, month,
year, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It would be found very useful in preventing
and detecting the mistakes which so frequently
occur in the delivery of letters, if the seals in common
use were provided with at least two of these
revolving circles, with the day of the month and
hour of the day engraved on their face, parallel
to the stone. A particular part of the arms or
cipher being used as an index hand, it would then
show the precise hour the letter was sent, without
the trouble of dating, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In engraved seals where coats of arms are used,
it will be obvious that the seal must be larger
than those generally in use, as the circles must
be made to revolve round the outer extremity of
the stone, and their usefulness will be considerably
diminished. With regard to the possibility
of forming a key by which writing in any language
may be deciphered, we have the following
curious anecdote, furnished by the late learned
and ingenious Mr. Astle, keeper of His Majesty's
Records: he states, on the authority of a noble
Lord, deceased, that the late Earl Granville,
while Secretary of State, told him, that when he
came into office he had his doubts respecting the
certainty of deciphering. That he wrote down
two or three sentences in the Swedish language,
and afterwards put them into such arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
marks or characters, as his mind suggested to
him; that he sent the paper to Dr. Willes, who
returned it the next day, and informed his lordship,
that the characters he had sent to him
formed certain words, which he had written beneath
the cipher, but that he did not understand
the language; and Lord Granville declared, that
the words were exactly those which he had first
written, before he put them into cipher.</p></blockquote>


<h2>No. II.</h2>

<p>How ten thousand persons may use these
seals to all and every of the purposes aforesaid,
and yet keep their secrets from any
but whom they please.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As the mode of deciphering inscriptions, dates,
&amp;c. formed by these seals, depends on a key,
the formation of which is arbitrary, and resting
entirely upon the fancy or ingenuity of its
composer; it follows, that the smallest variation
from the one originally intended for that purpose,
will entirely destroy the effect of the proposed
combination.</p></blockquote>


<h2>No. III.</h2>

<p>A cipher and character so contrived, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
one line, without returns and circumflexes,
stands for each and every one of the twenty-four
letters; and as ready to be made for
the one letter as the other.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of this and the following invention, the noble
author has left to the curious in the stenographic
art, his own definition; a manuscript, in the
Marquis's hand-writing, having been preserved
in the <cite>Harleian Collection</cite>, appended to an original
copy of the Century of Inventions, in which he
explains the system upon which these two articles
are founded. The MS. alluded to is thus entitled:&mdash;"An
Explanation of the most exact and
most compendious way of Short-hand Writing;
and an Example, given by way of Questions and
Resolves upon each significant Point, proving how
and why it stands for such and such a Letter, in
order, alphabetically placed in every page."&mdash;<cite>Bibl.
Harl.</cite> No. 2428.</p>

<p>The above work is accompanied with engraved
brass plates; and his system, which is simple and
easy of attainment, may be thus described:&mdash;A
sheet of paper must first be prepared, with a
given number of horizontal rows of small octagons,
somewhat resembling the chequers on a
draft-board. Straight lines are then to be drawn
from the centre towards the sides of these squares,
in different positions, and of various lengths, for
each letter in the alphabet. Thus, A is a short
horizontal stroke, made to the right hand, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
touching the side; E, A, and W, are represented
by a similar stroke in the opposite direction, but
varying in their lengths. By a similar method
the author suggests, in the following article, that
we may write with a dot, or single point only,
placed in a given situation in the octagon; varying
the position for each letter, as is at present
done in music, the paper being prepared with
ruled lines, or it may be simplified by the use of
coloured inks for the vowels and consonants.</p></blockquote>


<h2>No. IV.</h2>

<p>This invention refined, and so abbreviated,
that a point only showeth distinctly and significantly
any of the twenty-four letters;
and these very points to be made with two
pens, so that no time will be lost, but as one
finger riseth, the other may make the following
letter, never clogging the memory
with several figures for words, and combinations
of letters; which, with ease and void
of confusion, are thus speedily and punctually,
letter for letter, set down by naked
and not multiplied points. And nothing can
be less than a point, the mathematical definition
of it being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cujus pars nulla</i>. And of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
motion, equally as swift as <i>semiquavers</i> or
<i>relishes</i>, yet applicable to this manner of
writing.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Vide</i> the preceding article.</p></blockquote>


<h2>No. V.</h2>

<p>A way, by a circular motion, either along
a rule or ring-wise, to vary any alphabet,
even this of points, so that the self same
point, individually placed, without the least
additional mark or variation of place, shall
stand for all the twenty-four letters, and not
for the same letter twice in ten sheets writing;
yet as easily and certainly read and known,
as if it stood but for one and the self same
letter constantly signified.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The gauge, in this case, must accompany the
letter to be deciphered, and, when circular, made
to resemble a <em>map-meter</em>. By noticing the number
of lines passed over by this instrument, and comparing
the index-hand with the dots, a sufficiently
intelligible though certainly complex cipher may
be formed.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>


<h2>No. VI.</h2>

<p>How, at a window, as far as eye can discover
black from white, a man may hold
discourse with his correspondent, without
noise made or noise taken; being, according
to occasion given and means afforded,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex re natâ</i>, and no need of provision beforehand;
though much better if foreseen, and
means prepared for it, and a premeditated
course taken by mutual consent of parties.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The <em>telegraph</em>, though not generally used in
Europe till the commencement of the French
revolution, appears to have been well known to
the ancients. Polybius describes a method of
communication, which was invented by Cleoxenus,
which answered both by day and night.
Kircher and Scott likewise allude to its use; but
the description given by the Marquis is evidently
superior to any that had preceded him; and, indeed,
must have nearly resembled that in use at
the present period.</p></blockquote>


<h2>No. VII.</h2>

<p>A way to do it by night as well as by day,
though as dark as pitch is black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The allusion here to a telegraphic communication
is likewise sufficiently evident; though it is
obvious that, for night signals, it will become necessary
to substitute rockets or reflecting lamps
for the painted boards.</p>

<p>Among the signs for nightly information at a
distance, those by fire are extremely common, and
have been used by the Chinese, Persians, and
other nations, in the remotest times. This species
of communication is affirmed by Diodorus
Siculus to have been practised by Medea in her
conspiracy with Jason, which carries us back three
thousand and seventy years; and although there
must be some uncertainty on this question, Pliny,
in his "History," lib. vii. cap. 56, says, it originated
with Sinon. "Specularem significationem
Trojano bello Sinon invenit." This was the signal
upon which Sinon agreed to unlock the wooden
horse in the siege of Troy, about 1184 years before
Christ:</p>

<p class="center">
"&mdash;&mdash;Flammas cum regia puppis<br />
Extulerat."</p>

<p class="sig">
<cite>Virgil.</cite> <i>Æn.</i> lib. ii. 256.
</p>

<p>And, after the taking of Troy, Æschylus relates,
that Agamemnon immediately apprized his queen,
Clytemnestra, of that event by a similar method;
which, we suppose, must have been done either
by men placed at certain distances with lighted
torches, which they held up in succession, or by
a considerable number of fires on the tops of hills,
denoting the simple fact previously agreed on between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the parties. See Onosander's Strategicus,
cap. 25, where this practice is described.</p>

<p>The fire-signals of the Greeks and Romans are
also slightly mentioned by Quintus Curtius, Livy,
Cæsar, Herodotus, Homer, and Thucydides;
likewise by Vegetius and Frontinus; but still more
in detail by Polybius and Æneas Tacticus; the
latter of whom was contemporary with Aristotle,
and has left a valuable fragment on the duties of
a general, (translated into Latin by Casaubon,)
wherein are many curious remarks on the subject
of secret correspondence. The Greek signals
were much improved by Polybius, who, in his
history, (lib. x. cap. 45. p. 296. tom. iii. Lips.
1790. edit. Joh. Schweighaeuser,) attributes the
invention to Cleomenes and Democritus, or (more
correctly) to Cleoxenus and Democlitus, in words
thus rendered: "Postrema ratio, cujus auctores
sunt Cleoxenus et Democlitus, sed quam nos correximus,
certa definitaque est, adeo ut quidquid
exortum fuerit negotii, id possis certo facere notum."
Prior to that period, the information communicated
by torches, flags, smoke, or otherwise,
was very limited, and it was requisite to settle
beforehand what each signal should mean; whereas
Polybius showed how to correspond alphabetically,
and to give or receive any species of intelligence,
without this previous concert. The plans
of Æneas Tacticus had never arrived at such perfection,
and were therefore of comparatively small
use; though, without doubt, he at least equalled
any of his predecessors in the facility of his telegraphic
communications.</p></blockquote>

<p>A way, from a mile off, to dive and fasten

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Fulton, of the United States, the inventor
of the <i>Torpedo</i>, recommends the use of a gun-harpoon
for fixing this destructive engine on the side
of a ship; but this plan appears liable to two objections:
the resistance that would be offered by the
water, should the harpoon be fired from a considerable
distance; and the certainty of discovery
from the report of the cannon, on a near approach
to the hull of the vessel. The methods most eligible
for this object appear to be, either to let the
machine float with the tide, and by striking against
the side of the vessel discharge a gun-lock; or
else, by employing a <em>diving-bell</em>, pass beneath the
surface of the water. In proof of the practicability
of the latter plan, about the time of the attack
made by the English at Boulogne, Buonaparte
caused a small diving vessel to be made, which,
at a preconcerted signal, lowered its masts, yards,
&amp;c.; and by admitting a certain quantity of
water sunk it to the required depth; it was then
impelled forward by means of a circular paddle
or wheel turned within the vessel, and upon the
air becoming foul or exhausted, the vessel was
raised to the surface by means of pumps or dropping
of ballast. It appears more than probable,
that this is the species of vessel to which the
Marquis alludes. Hook, in his <cite>Philosophical Collections</cite>,
No. 2, describes an air-vessel possessing
similar properties with the above.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A safe and easy method of preventing the
dreadful consequences attendant on the explosion
of this tremendous machine, may be found in the
use of a strong net, resembling that used in the
salmon fishery; which must be kept at the required
distance from the vessel by floating buoys
placed for that purpose. It will also be necessary
to fix a bell upon the upper extremity of each
buoy, which will, by its ringing on a calm night,
discover the approach of any hydrostatic vessel;
and should the weather be stormy, the attempt
must end in the destruction of the sub-marine
voyagers.</p></blockquote>

scarcely be possible to sink it, especially if a large
sheet, well prepared with oakum, be drawn under
the vessel in the event of a fracture occurring, as
the pressure of the water on the surface of the
vessel will force the canvass into the chasm, and
allow of the necessary reparation. The latter
method has been adopted in the navy for several
years.</p></blockquote>

was invented by M. Desquinemare, consists of a
kind of globe placed on the top of a mast, on
which it always turns round with the wind. In
consequence of the ingenious adjustment of the
curves which it presents in all its points, the
rotary motion is always in the same direction, be
that of the wind as it may; and their utmost violence,
instead of being detrimental to its action,
only augments its power. The means of the instrument

batteries of prodigious force were used by
the Spaniards in their attack on Gibraltar, in 1782.
Their upper decks were at an angle of about
forty-five degrees, and composed of successive
layers of oak-planking and raw hides. These
offered an irresistible barrier to the shot and
shells commonly used, till General Elliot decided
on the application of red-hot balls, which, by
burning a passage through the outer layers,
quickly communicated to that part of the hold

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The most celebrated gardens of this description
were those made by the Mexicans on the
great lake which surrounds the capital; here they
planted trees, and cultivated maize, pepper, and
other plants necessary for their support. In progress
of time, as these floating fields grew numerous
from the industry of the people, they formed
among them gardens for flowers and other odoriferous
plants, which were employed in the worship
of their gods, and which served also for the
recreation of the nobles. Every day of the year,
at sun-rise, innumerable vessels, laden with various
kinds of flowers and herbs, cultivated on the
water, arrived by the canal, at the great market-place
of the capital.</p>

<p>To form their floats, they first plait or twist
willows, with roots of marsh plants, and upon
this foundation they place the mud and dirt which
they draw from the bed of the lake. When the
owner of a garden wishes to change his situation,
to remove from a disagreeable neighbour, or to
come nearer his own family, he gets into his
little vessel and tows the plantation after him.&mdash;Vide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

<p>How to compose an universal character,
methodical and easy to be written, yet intelligible
in any language; so that if an Englishman

perfectly understand it in their own tongue
as if they were English, distinguishing the
verbs from the nouns, the numbers, tenses,
and cases, as properly expressed in their own
language as it was written in English.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The great difficulty which the various contrivers
of a universal character or philosophical
language have hitherto had to encounter, from the
Marquis of Worcester and Bishop Wilkins down
to M. Lodowick, appears to have arisen rather
from the difficulty attendant on engaging the
several nations to use it, than in inventing the
most convenient character.</p>

<p>The <em>real character</em> of Bishop Wilkins, which
there is every reason to suppose strongly resembled
that of his contemporary the Marquis, was
repeatedly recommended by Dr. Hook, who, to
engage the world in the study of it, published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
some curious inventions of his own, tending to its
illustration. But the most accurate notice on the
history of <em>pasigraphy</em> yet published appeared in
the <cite>Spect. du Nord</cite> for May, 1798. The anonymous
author of this interesting memoir commences
by a brief inquiry into the nature and utility of the
universal character, and then proceeds with this very
just eulogium on our immortal countryman Bacon.</p>

<p>It is generally allowed that Lord Bacon of Verulam
comprehended nearly the whole circle of
human knowledge at the period in which he lived,
and foresaw most of the discoveries which have
since been made. He laid the foundation of an
Encyclopædia, and was very near discovering various
important philosophical results, such as the
weight of the air, &amp;c. If we open his book on the
progress of the sciences, we shall find the notion
of a pasigraphy in the chapter entitled <i>The Instrument
of Discourse</i>. "It is possible to invent such
signs," says he, "for the communication of our
thoughts, that people of different languages may,
by this means, understand each other; and that
each may read immediately in his own language, a
book which shall be written in another." But Bacon
did not think of confining this to twelve characters:
on the contrary, he requires a great number,
at least as many as the number of radical words;
on which head he quotes the example of the Chinese;
"and although," adds he, "our alphabet
may appear more commodious than this method
of writing, the thing itself nevertheless is well
deserving of attention. The problem relates to
the signs by which thoughts may be rendered
current; and, as money may be struck of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
materials as well as gold and silver, it is possible
likewise to discover other signs of things as well
as letters and words."</p>

<p>Des Cartes, in his third letter to father Mercennus,
discusses the invention of a Frenchman,
whom he does not name, but who, by means of a
certain language and an artificial writing, pretended
to understand all the different idioms. He remarks
on this subject, that it would be very possible
to compose a short and convenient grammar,
with general signs, which should render all foreign
languages intelligible.</p>

<p>In the year 1661, John Joachim Becher published
a Latin folio, the title of which was "Characters
for the Universal Knowledge of Languages:
a Stenographic Invention hitherto unheard of."
This unheard of invention consists of a method by
which a native of any country may make himself
understood by all foreigners by writing in his own
language, and be enabled also to comprehend what
they write in theirs. It was truly at that time a
thing unheard of; for Becher, being the first who
had given a complete treatise on this art, may be
considered as the inventor.</p>

<p>He begins his work by a series of highly interesting
observations upon general grammar, and
the fundamental relations of all languages with
regard to each other. He gives a learned comparative
table of the relations and harmony of the
Latin, the Greek, the Hebrew, the Arabian, the
Sclavonian, the French, and the German. This
work cannot be too highly esteemed, and assuredly
was not unknown to the author of the work <cite>Du
Monde Primitif</cite>. A Latin dictionary then follows,
in which every word corresponds with one or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more Arabic numeral figures arbitrarily taken.
Every number is assumed as distinctive, or denoting
the same word in all languages; and consequently
nothing more is required than to compose
a dictionary for each, similar to that which
he has given for the Latin.</p>

<p>There is likewise a table of declensions and
conjugations, which presents certain determinate
numbers for all the cases, moods, tenses, or persons.
By means of this general disposition, when
a Frenchman is desirous of writing to a German
the following phrase, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La guerre est un grand mal</i>
(war is a great evil), he seeks in his index, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">guerre</i>,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal</i>; and he writes the correspondent
numbers,</p>

<p class="center">
13, 33, 67, 68.
</p>

<p>The sentence might be understood by these four
characteristic numbers; but, to leave no room for
ambiguity, he says, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guerre</i> is the nominative case,
and finds, as the characteristic of the nominative,
the Arabic figure 1. <em>Est</em> is the third person singular
of the indicative mood, present tense, of
which the characteristic is 15. To <em>grand</em>, and to
<em>mal</em>, belong likewise the figure 1, for the nominative
case; he will therefore write</p>

<p class="center">
13.1 | 33.15 | 67.1 | 68.1 |
</p>

<p>where the numbers are separated by small vertical
bars to prevent confusion. It may easily be conceived
how, by the inverse method, the German
will find in his tables the words denoted by the
ciphers, which will form <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der krieg ist ein grosses
uebel</i>.</p>

<p>This invention of Becher, which is the same
thing nearly with regard to language, as algebra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
is to arithmetic, is possessed of considerable simplicity,
and even a few hours practice will render
it easy. A great variety of attempts on this principle
may be found in Sturmius, <cite>Essais d'Expériences
Curieuses</cite>.</p>

<p>In the same year, George Dalgaru, an Englishman,
published in London a work of which the
prolix title is sufficient to show its object. It runs
thus, "The Art of Signs, or an Universal Character
and Philosophical Language, by Means of which,
Men of the most different Idioms may, in the
Space of two Weeks, learn to communicate, whether
by Word of Mouth or by Writing, all their
Thoughts, as clearly as in their Mother Tongue.
Besides which, young Persons may therein learn
the Principles of Philosophy, and the Practice of
true Logic, more speedily and more readily than
in the ordinary philosophic Writings." The book
of Dalgaru is written in Latin, and Beckman
accuses him of extreme pedantry. His characters
likewise were ciphers.</p>

<p>Joachim Frisichius, professor at the Gymnasium
at Riga, was employed on a similar attempt,
his object being to introduce a natural, rational,
and universal language, of which some sheets
printed at Thorn in 1681 contain the only specimen
extant. The death of the author interrupted
his labours. He purposed to call his new language
Ludovicean, in honour of Louis XIV., under
whose patronage he pursued his labours; a prince
whose generosity was extended to the learned of
all countries.</p>

<p>Athanasius Kircher also published a work on
this subject, entitled "A New and Universal
Polygraphia, deduced from the Art of Combination,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and by means of which, says Morhoff, (Polyhistor,
l. ii. c. 5.) he who understands one language
only may correspond in writing with all the nations
of the earth.</p>

<p>It would perhaps be unjust to pass in silence
the little-known work of father Besnier, a Jesuit,
who, in a book entitled <cite>La Réunion des Langues, ou
l'Art de les apprendre toutes par une seule</cite>, printed
at Paris in 1674, has furnished many important
hints for the cultivation of this branch of language.</p>

<p>The most remarkable work, however, which
has been written on this subject, is that for which
we are indebted to Bishop Wilkins, the brother-in-law
of Cromwell: it is entitled, "An Essay
towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language,
London, 1668." It is divided into four
parts: 1st, Considerations on the various languages,
their defects and imperfections, from
which a philosophic language ought to be exempt.
2dly, Philosophical inquiries respecting all the
things and notions to which proper names ought
to be assigned. 3dly, The organic science of
native grammar considered as the necessary means
of representing simple ideas in discourse. 4thly,
The application of the general rules to every character
and language. Examples, &amp;c. This concise
outline sufficiently shows the importance of
the work.</p>

<p>In his appendix, the author explains the utility
of a method of writing without alphabetic characters,
by means of signs, which are to be used to
denote all the principal ideas, the relative attributes
being designated by small strokes added at
right, acute, or obtuse angles, to the right or left;
&amp;c. Of principal or chief ideas he admits but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
forty, under which he ranges all the others, by
that means forming a series of categories. His
new language is calculated to afford great facility
of comprehension, and new openings to the various
processes of science.</p>

<p>After so many attempts, more or less philosophical,
and of different degrees of perfection, with
others probably of which we know nothing, we
must not overlook the efforts of the celebrated
Leibnitz. His History and Development of a
Characteristic Universal Language is very generally
known. Leibnitz considered his universal
characteristic as the art of inventing and judging.
He stated his conviction that an alphabet might
be formed, and of this alphabet such words as
would afford a language capable of giving mathematical
precision to all the sciences. "Men may
thus acquire," says he, "as it were, a new organ,
which would add energy to their moral faculties,
as the microscopic lens increases the power of the
eye. The compass is not more highly valuable
to the navigator, than this philosophical language
would be to him who embarks on the sea of reason
and experiments, which is now so full of danger."</p>

<p>In concluding this brief sketch, it may be
enough to notice the ingenious method of the Abbé
de l'Epée, who, by means of various gestures, dictated
to his various deaf and dumb pupils certain
discourses, which they wrote with equal readiness
in four languages.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This very ingenious mode of secret writing is
the most simple of any suggested by our author.
A silk string of considerable length having been
provided, it will be necessary to furnish the persons
corresponding with a key or graduated gauge,
by means of which the writing will be rendered
intelligible. Having procured a duplicate or corresponding
gauge it may then be commenced,
1/16 of an inch being allowed for the first letter,
1/4 for the second, 3/8 for the third, and so on, in
equal proportions, through the whole alphabet.
Should this arrangement be found to extend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
line to an inconvenient length, it may be advisable
to form a certain number of changes on three
different lengths, as in No. LII.; though the

most desirable way, the beads are set to the
required distance; by the third, the gloves are
pierced or pricked in rows, according to the divisions
on the gauge; and by the fourth and fifth,
the rows of parallel holes in a sieve or lantern
are stopped at the required distances, and the
gauge applied as before.</p></blockquote>

<p>This object may be readily attained by the use

<p>A mode of corresponding by the touch has been
suggested by M. Haüy, and by this means the
blind have been fully instructed, not only in the
rudiments of language, but also in the liberal arts
and sciences. M. Haüy's method of preparing
the books, &amp;c., which is simple and easy of attainment,
is as follows: when the types have been
arranged and fixed, a page of very strong paper is
moistened, so as to be capable of receiving and
retaining impressions, and laid upon the types;
and then by the operation of a press or hammer,
frequently repeated over the surface, the impression
of the type is made to rise on the opposite
side of the paper; and it continues, when dry, not
only "obvious to the sight," but to the touch, and is
not easily effaced. On the upper side of the paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the letters appear in their proper position; and
by their sensible elevation above the common surface,
the blind may easily read them with their
fingers. For epistolary correspondence it will be
necessary to moisten the paper and use a metal
pen.</p></blockquote>

a small quantity of inflammable spirits sprinkled
over it, the slightest spark will throw the whole

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is most probable that the Marquis here alludes
to the geometrical staircase now in such
general use, with the addition of a small flight of
stairs in the centre, in lieu of the common handrail,
which being surrounded by a partition of boards,
would readily serve as a private communication
with the upper stories: sufficient space being left
between the ceiling and under side of the principal
staircase to admit of a passage to the inner rooms.
Since writing the above, the Editor has seen a more
explicit account of this species of staircase. It occurs
in "Evelin's Memoirs," vol. i. page 59, and
forms part of that learned and amusing author's
tour through France in 1644. The following is
an extract. "Quitting our barke, we hired horses
to Blois, by way of Chambourg, a famous house
of y<sup>e</sup> King's, built by Francis I. in the middle of
a solitary parke, full of deere; the enclosure is a
wall. I was particularly desirous of seeing this
palace, from the extravagance of the design, especially
the <em>stayrecase</em>, mentioned by Palladio. It is
said that 1800 workmen were constantly employed
in this fabric for twelve yeares; if so, it is wonderfull
that it was not finish'd, it being no greater
than divers gentlemen's houses in England, both
for roome or circuit. The carvings are very rich
and full. The stayrecase is devised w<sup>th</sup> four entries
or ascents, which cross one another, so that
though four persons meete, they never come in
sight, but by small loope-holes, till they land.
It consists of 274 steps (as I remember), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
is an extraordinary worke, but of far greater expense
than use or beauty."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not very easy to discover to what the noble
author here alludes: if by <em>tobacco-tongs</em>, he means
a combination of levers such as is used by gardeners,
to gather choice fruit or lop the upper boughs of
trees, the mode of applying them is extremely
easy. A number of short pieces of brass, jointed
together, and made to resemble a row of <em>trellis</em>
work, may, by distending the joints in an horizontal
direction, be made to go in the smallest
compass; and again, by closing the arms, the
machine will be elevated. An ingenious mechanic
has constructed a <em>fire-escape</em> upon this principle,
of which a model is preserved in the Museum of
the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<p>How to make a water-screw tight, and

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This may be readily effected either by making
a coarse screw in the usual manner, and covering
it with horn, or by fitting a spiral tube of glass on
a wooden cylinder, and filling up the interstices
with wax or any hard cement so as to project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
beyond the glass tube: this appears the most
eligible method, though the former is the most
economical.</p>

<p>M. A. Rochon has likewise proposed a most
ingenious substitute for the use of horn in the
construction of the Archimedean screw, and other
hydraulic instruments. It is formed (like the
safety lamp of Sir H. Davy) of a coarse wire
gauze which, on being immersed in pure fish-glue
or size, forms when varnished a cheap and
durable substitute for the use of glass.</p></blockquote>

<p>This appears one of those extraordinary slight
of hand discoveries in which the noble author is

employed in turning of any water-wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where an abundant supply is found at the

than has been previously raised, or, if so,
how the machine could be at all applied to the

but tried before the late king of happy and
glorious memory, in the Tower, by my directions;
two extraordinary ambassadors
accompanying his Majesty, and the Duke
of Richmond, and Duke Hamilton, with
most of the court attending him. The
wheel was fourteen feet over, and forty
weights of fifty pounds a-piece. Sir William
Belford, then Lieutenant of the Tower,
can testify it, with several others. They all
saw, that no sooner these great weights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
passed the diameter line of the upper side,
but they hung a foot farther from the centre;
nor no sooner passed the diameter line of
the lower side, but they hung a foot nearer.
Be pleased to judge the consequence.</p>


<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The celebrated problem of a self-impelling
power, though denied by Huygens and de la Hire,
who have attempted to demonstrate its fallacy,
has yet been supported by some of the most celebrated
among the ancient as well as modern philosophers.
Innumerable have been the machines
to which the idea of <em>the perpetual motion</em> has given
birth; but the most celebrated among the moderns
is the <i>Orffyrean wheel</i>. This machine, according
to the description given of it by M.
Grævesande, in his <cite>Œuvres Philosophiques</cite>, consisted
of a large circular wheel or drum, twelve
feet in diameter, and fourteen inches in depth.
It was composed of a number of thin deals, the
spaces between which were covered with wax
cloth, in order to conceal the interior parts of it.
On giving the wheel, which rested on the two
extremities of an iron axis, a slight impulse in
either direction, its motion was gradually accelerated;
so that after two or three revolutions it is
said to have acquired so great a velocity as to
make twenty-five or more turns in a minute: and
it appears to have preserved this rapid motion
for the space of two months, during which time
the Landgrave of Hesse, in whose chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it was placed to prevent a possibility of collusion,
kept his own seal on the outer door. At
the end of that time it was stopped to prevent
the wear of the materials. Grævesande, who
had been an eye-witness to the performance of
this machine, examined all the external parts

any communication between it and the adjacent

of the ill-timed curiosity of the professor,
and incensed at the refusal of a premium of <em>twenty
thousand pounds</em>, which he had made a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ

broke the whole apparatus into atoms, and
his life was soon after sacrificed to chagrin at his
disappointment. The analogy between the Marquis's
description and the Orffyrean wheel is
sufficiently evident; and the experiment having
been made in the Tower, more than fifty years
prior to the attempt of the German mechanic, it
is more than probable that the idea was derived
from the noble author's work.</p></blockquote>

<p>This invention, which is evidently more a matter

effected upon the principle of an ebbing and flowing

a commensurate rise of the water, fills a syphon,
and sets the water-work in motion, but as the
effect of this would cease after the two vessels
attained an equilibrium, the machine must be
assisted by a moving power attached to one or
both of the vessels, as the Marquis merely says,
that it may be performed "without the help of

<p>How to make a pistol to discharge a dozen
times with one loading, and without so much

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An attentive examination of this and the subsequent
articles has suggested what appears an
improvement of considerable importance in the
principle of modern fire-arms. The expense attendant
on the manufacture of double barrelled
guns, and the inconvenience which arises from
their additional weight, have hitherto prevented
their coming into general use, though their utility in
the field is very generally allowed. An economical
gun uniting all the advantages of the one,
with the lightness and portability of the other,
must therefore be considered as a desideratum of
the first importance. To effect this, a common
gun barrel must be pierced with the required number
of touchholes, at a sufficient distance to allow
of an equal number of charges. A detonating
magazine gunlock may then be made to slide on
the lower part of the barrel, with a parallel ratchet
and click to fix precisely opposite the touchhole
to be inflamed. The gun must then be
loaded by a graduated ramrod, the powder of
each charge being brought opposite its proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
touchhole. After the first discharge, the cock
must be moved back one tooth of the ratchet,
and this motion continued till the whole are exploded,
each hole being covered successively by
a plate attached to the lock.</p>

<p>No. 60 is evidently performed by filling a cylindrical
flask, made the same size as the barrel,
with the required number of charges and afterwards
forcing the whole of them into the barrel.</p>

<p>Nos. 61 and 67 may be performed by filling
a flask previously made to fit the breech of the
musket, and forcing forward each successive
charge by a screw or lever, in the same manner
as the charging is effected in a magazine air-gun.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The two principal properties of this escutcheon
may be readily contrived; and the first of them
has, in fact, been already applied to a very ingenious
padlock, invented by Mr. Marshall, and
for which the Society of Arts voted him a reward
of ten guineas. In Mr. M.'s escutcheon the letters
or figures commonly used in the ring padlock
allow an almost endless variety of changes, and
the owner may in one minute alter the arrangement
in such a manner that even the maker would
experience as much difficulty to open it, as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
entire stranger to its construction. To render
the combination of letters variable, the characters
must not be engraved upon the outside of the rollers
themselves, but upon a thin brass hoop made
to fit on its outer surface; and a spring fastened
to the roller, and pressing upon the inside of the
hoop, will cause a sufficient degree of friction to
make them move together.</p>

<p>The other part of this invention is equally simple
with the preceding. An alarum, such as is
attached to a clock, may easily be wound up prior
to closing the box; and the lid provided with a
chamfered bolt or staple, capable of effecting its
discharge when the box is opened.</p>

<p>To register the amount of money taken from
the box, it will be necessary either to place each
distinct piece of money in separate divisions, or
to put a number together in one deep recess capable
of admitting but one piece to pass at a time.
As the pieces are shaken out, they will in their
passage raise a lever capable of moving a wheel
one division in the passage of each piece.</p>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Innumerable are the schemes that have been proposed
by the learned at different periods, to enable
man to support himself in the air by the means
of artificial wings, &amp;c. and some, indeed, of these
ingenious contrivances have formed the labours
of the most distinguished mechanical geniuses,
which are recorded in the early annals of science.</p>

<p>Bacon, and an Italian priest named Francisco
Lana, endeavoured to accomplish it by means of
two thin hollow globes, exhausted of air, which
being considerably lighter than that fluid, were
intended to sustain a chair suspended to their
lower extremity, and on which the aeronaut might
be seated. But Dr. Hook, in a work published
some time after the <i>Prodromo</i> of Lana, plainly
showed the fallacy of the attempt, though without
in the least attempting to deny the possibility of
eventually effecting this object.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilkins, who was also a disciple of the
flying system, describes a species of land-sailing
vessels or chariots, which were then commonly
used in China: and it is rather a curious fact that
a German Count, possessing as much of modesty
as the generality of foreign mechanics, has lately
given to the public, as his own, an invention which
has been known in Europe, and occasionally employed
in Asia, for the last four hundred years.</p>

<p>But of all the plans that have hitherto been devised,
those only which have mechanic power as
their basis appear to have any chance of success.
This may be considered as an unerring <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">datum</i> to
guide the future experimentalist, the certainty of
which is fully demonstrated by a comparison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the powers of the human frame with those of the
feathered tribe: for it has been calculated by an
ingenious anatomist, that the muscles which move
the wings downwards in a bird in many instances,
constitute not less than the sixth part of the weight
of the whole body; while those of a man are not
one hundredth part so large. By the use of springs,
however, wound to a certain degree of tension,
prior to embarking upon the intended expedition,
and acting upon cranks working the wings, the
same power as that possessed by the feathered
race may be obtained, and the springs may be
readily made to draw more than fifty times their
weight. By this means a whalebone, or other
light carriage, may be raised, though it would be
but for a short time, as it would not be in the
power of the aëronaut to wind the springs so
quick as the machine would require.</p>

<p>From this, then, it will be seen that, to produce
the effect necessary for this species of navigation,
it is only requisite to have a first mover, which
will produce more power, in a given time, in proportion
to its weight, than the animal system of
muscles.</p>

<p>High pressure steam-engines have been made
to operate by expansion only, and they, it appears,
might be constructed so as to be light enough for
this purpose. In that case, however, it will be
evident that the usual plan of a large boiler must
be given up, and the principle of injecting a proper
charge of water into a series of tubes, forming
the cavity of the fire, must be adopted in lieu
of it.</p>

<p>The following estimate will show the probable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
weight of such an engine with its charge for one
hour.</p>

<p>It may at first view appear superfluous to inquire
further relative to a first mover for aërial
navigation; but lightness is of so much value in
this instance, that it is proper to notice the probability
that exists of using the expansion of air by
the sudden combustion of inflammable powders or
fluids with great advantage. The French have
experimentally shown the great power produced
by igniting inflammable fluids in close vessels;
and several years ago, an engine was made in this
country to work in a similar manner, by the inflammation
of spirit of tar.</p>

<p>It appears that eighty drops of this fluid raised
eight hundred weight to the height of 22 inches;
hence a one-horse power may consume from 10
to 12 pounds per hour, and the engine itself need
not exceed 50 pounds weight.</p>

<p>Probably a much cheaper engine of this sort
might be produced by gas-light apparatus, and
by firing the inflammable air generated, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
due portion of common air, under a piston. Upon
some of these principles it is perfectly clear that
force can be obtained by a much lighter apparatus
than the muscles of animals or birds, and therefore
in such proportion may aërial vehicles be
loaded with inactive matter. Even the high pressure
steam-engine doing the work of six men,
and only weighing equal to one, will readily raise
five men into the air, but by increasing the magnitude
of the engine ten, fifty; or even five hundred
men may equally well be conveyed.</p>

<p>Having rendered the accomplishment of this
object probable upon the general view of the subject,
it will now be necessary to point out the
principles of the art itself. The whole problem
is confined within these limits, viz. To make a
surface support a given weight by the application
of power to the resistance of the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been made upon the
direct resistance of air by Mr. Robins, Mr. Rouse,
Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Smeaton, and others. The
result of Mr. Smeaton's experiments and observations
was, that a surface of one square foot
met with a resistance of one pound, when it travelled
perpendicularly to itself through air at a
velocity of 21 feet per second.</p>

<p>Having ascertained this point, had our tables
of angular resistance been complete, the size of
the surface necessary for any given weight would
easily have been determined. Theory, which
gives the resistance of a surface opposed to the
same current in different angles, to be as the
squares of the sine of the angle of incidence, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of no use in this case; as it appears, from the experiments
of the French Academy, that in acute
angles, the resistance varies much more nearly to
the direct ratio of the sines, than as the squares
of the sines of the angles of incidence. The flight
of birds will prove to an attentive observer, that,
with a concave wing apparently parallel to the
horizontal path of the bird, the same support,
and of course resistance, is obtained. And hence
it appears that, under extremely acute angles with
concave surfaces, the resistance is nearly similar
in them all.</p>

<p>Six degrees was the most acute angle, the resistance
of which was determined by the valuable
experiments of the French Academy; and it gave
4/10 of the resistance, which the same surface would
have received from the same current when perpendicular
to itself. Hence then a superficial
foot, forming an angle of six degrees with the
horizon, would, if carried forward horizontally
(as a bird in the act of skimming) with a velocity
of 23·6 feet per second, receive a pressure of 4/10
of a pound perpendicular to itself. And if we
allow the resistance to increase as the square of
the velocity, at 27·3 feet per second it would receive
a pressure of one pound.</p>

<p>The flight of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corvus frugilegus</i>, or rook, during
any part of which it can skim at pleasure, is
(from an average of many observations) about 34·5
feet per second. The concavity of the wing may
account for the greater resistance here received,
than the experiments upon plain surfaces would
indicate.</p>

<p>The angle made use of in the crow's wing is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
much more acute than six degrees: but in the
observations that will be grounded upon these
data, it may safely be stated that every foot of
such curved surface, as will be used in aërial navigation,
will receive a resistance of one pound,
perpendicular to itself, when carried through the
air in an angle of six degrees with the line of its
path, at a velocity of about 34 or 35 feet per second.</p>

<p>The next object is to apply what has been
advanced to the theory of aërial navigation; and
the following description will convey a just idea
of the best method of effecting it. Suppose a
sail to be made of thin cloth, of a firm texture,
containing two hundred square feet; and that
the weight of the man and the apparatus is 200
pounds. Then if the wind blow with a velocity
of 35 feet per second, in a certain direction, at
the same time that a cord in that direction sustains
a tension of 21 lbs. from being fixed to the
machine, the whole apparatus will be suspended
in the air. But it is perfectly indifferent whether
the wind blow against the plane, or the plane be
propelled by any means against the air with an
unequal velocity. Hence, if this machine were
drawn forward by the cord under a tension of
21 lbs. and with a velocity of 35 feet per second,
the whole would be suspended in an horizontal
path. Now, if, instead of this cord, any other
propelling power were generated in the same direction,
and with the same intensity, an equivalent
effect would be produced, and aërial navigation
accomplished. <i>Vide Bishop Wilkins's Math.
Magic.&mdash;Hook's Philosophical Collections.&mdash;Sir G.
Cayley on Aërial Navigation.</i></p></blockquote>

of a like description.</p>

<p>The <i>Abacus</i> was variously contrived; that chiefly
used in European countries was made by drawing
any number of parallel lines at pleasure, at a distance
from each other, equal to twice the diameter
of a <i>calculus</i> or counter. This placed on the
lowest line, signified 1; on the second, 10; on
the third, 100; on the fourth, 1000; on the fifth,
10,000; and so on. In the spaces between the
lines, the same counters signified half of what
they represented on the next superior line; viz.
in the space between the first and second lines, 5;
between the second and third, 50; between the
third and fourth, 500; and so on. The abacus
was also divided cross-wise into <i>areolæ</i>, and by
this means subtractions were performed. The
calculating instrument of Mr. Babbage is however
much superior to any other contrivance yet
suggested.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The usual method of dipping <em>store candles</em> is
subject to many objections, though the expense
attendant on casting those called <em>moulds</em> has hitherto
been an impediment to their general manufacture.
A more simple method now offers itself, which is
equally advantageous and economical. A quantity
of drawn tubes being first cut into the given
lengths, metal collars must then be soldered on
the extremity of each length, with an orifice of
sufficient size to allow the tallow and wick to pass
through the whole series of tubes. They must
then be connected together by a screw cut in each
alternate end, and the whole, thus formed, passed
through a steam pipe of sufficient size to prevent
the tallow chilling in its passage through the
moulds. When cold, each joint of the mould
must be separately unscrewed and the candles
separated by a sharp knife.</p>

<p>A means of purifying the tallow, and as such,
of rendering the candles whiter and more durable,
likewise suggests itself in the following simple
process. The vat, or copper, containing the melted
tallow, must be provided with a shower bath
placed immediately over the surface, to which must
be attached a reservoir of cold water: this, by the
action of a lever, may be thrown through the grating
of the bath, and falling upon the tallow, will, in its
passage, carry to the bottom of the vat the whole
of the carbonised animal matter and other impurities
with which it is charged. After allowing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
few minutes for the lighter fluid to rise, the water
may then be drawn off, by a cock placed at the
bottom of the vat for that purpose, and the same
process repeated till the tallow is fit for use.</p></blockquote>

Elizabeth also had milled money coined in England
about the same period; but it did not continue
for more than ten years; and it was not till
1662, that the screw press was finally established

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Albertus Magnus, a celebrated philosopher of
the thirteenth century, is said to have constructed
an <em>automaton</em> which not only performed all the
apparent motions of life, but absolutely answered
questions. It is recorded of Thomas Aquinas,
that, having accidentally seen the head, he was so
terrified that he broke it in pieces, upon which
Albert exclaimed: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Periit opus triginta annorum</i>!
Though this appears one of the earliest instances
of a speaking automaton constructed by one of
the laity, there is no doubt but that the method
of conveying answers to various interrogatories,
by the agency of concealed pipes or a speaking
trumpet, was practised at a very early period.
That the impostor Alexander, however, caused
his Æsculapius to speak in this manner is expressly
related by Lucan. He took, says this author,
instead of a pipe, the gullet of a crane, and transmitted
the voice through it to the mouth of the
statue. But the invention of the <em>invisible girl</em>,
which may be considered as an improvement on
the oracular responses of the darker ages, infinitely
surpassed any of those hitherto recorded.</p>

<p>This very ingenious apparatus was publicly exhibited
both at Bristol and in London for a considerable
period, during which time no discovery
was made of its internal mechanism; and it is
probable that its construction would have remained
a secret to all but the exhibitors, but for the
ingenuity of Mr. (now Professor) Millington, who,
in a course of Lectures delivered in the winter of
1806, explained the manner in which it was performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>visible</em> part of the apparatus connected with
the <em>invisible girl</em> was thus constructed: first a mahogany
frame resembling a bedstead, having at
the corners four upright posts about five feet high,
was united by a cross-rail near the top, and two
or more cross-rails near the bottom, to strengthen
the frame, which was about four feet square.
The frame thus constructed was placed upon the
floor, and to the top of each of the four pillars
were attached as many strong bent brass wires
converging towards the top, where they were secured
by a crown and other ornaments. From
these wires a hollow copper ball was suspended
by slight ribbons, so as to cut off all possible communication
with the frame. The globe thus supported
was supposed to contain the invisible being,
as the voice apparently proceeded from the interior
of it: and for this purpose, it was equipped with
four trumpets, placed round it in a horizontal
direction, and at right angles to each other; the
trumpet mouths coming to within about half an
inch of the respective cross-rails of the frame
surrounding them.</p>

<p>When a question was proposed, it was asked
from any side of the frame, and spoken into one
of the trumpets, and an answer immediately proceeded
from the whole of them, so loud as to be
distinctly heard by the inquirer, and yet so distant
and feeble, that it appeared as if coming from a
very diminutive being. In this the whole of the
artifice consisted; and the variations were so contrived
that the answer might be returned in several
languages, a kiss might be returned, the breath
producing the voice was felt, and songs were sung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
accompanied by the piano-forte, &amp;c. To produce
this illusion, the sound was conveyed by a tube, in
a manner similar to the old and well known contrivance
of the <em>speaking bust</em>; the invisible girl only
differing in one circumstance; that an artificial
echo was produced by means of the trumpets and
hollow globe, in consequence of which the sound
was completely reversed.</p>

<p>In the invisible girl the orifice of the tube was in
one of the handrails just opposite the mouth of
one of the trumpets, the opening being concealed
by reeds and other mouldings; the tube itself,
which was about half an inch in diameter, ran
through half the handrail, then down one of the
corner posts, and from thence under the floor
till it reached a large deal case almost similar to
an inverted funnel, along the side of which it rose
till it came nearly into contact with the ear of the
confederate, who with a piano-forte, &amp;c. was
concealed in this case. Any question asked by a
voice directed into one of the trumpets was immediately
reflected back from the concave interior
surface of the globe to the orifice of the tube,
along which it was conveyed so as to be distinctly
heard by the person in the deal case, who returned
the requisite answer, which appeared to come precisely
from the interior of the globe. A small
hole closed with glass was likewise left through
the deal case and side wall of the apartment, by
means of which the concealed person had an opportunity
of observing and commenting upon any
circumstance which occurred in the room.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any person who is acquainted with the various
automaton figures that have been constructed by
those celebrated mechanics, Vaucanson, Kempelen,
and Maelzel, will readily admit the possibility
of making a horse of this description; nor should
we too readily undervalue those mechanical pursuits,
which, though not of any immediate national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
advantage, have formed the employment of one
of the greatest potentates of modern Europe.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The most celebrated of the modern automata
were those made by Vaucanson, and which are
thus described by Beckman:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One of them, which represented a flute-player
sitting, performed twelve tunes, and, as we are assured,
by wind issuing from its mouth into a German
flute, the holes of which it opened and shut
with its fingers."</p>

<p>"The second was a standing figure, which in
like manner played on the Provençal shepherd's
pipe, which it held in its left hand, and with the
right beat upon a drum."</p>

<p>"The third was a duck, of the natural size,
which moved its wings, exhibited all the gestures
of that animal, quacked like a duck, drank water,
ate corn, and then, after a little time, let drop
behind it something that resembled the excrement
of a duck."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Of these automata, or rather <em>androides</em>, the flute-player
of Vaucanson is the only one of which a
correct description has been preserved; a particular
account of its mechanism having been published
in the Memoirs of the French Academy.
The figure was about five feet six inches high,
and was placed upon an elevated square pedestal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
The air entered the body by three separate pipes,
into which it was conveyed by nine pairs of bellows,
which expanded and contracted in regular
succession, by means of an axis of steel turned
by the machine. The three tubes, which conveyed
the air from the bellows, after passing through
the lower extremities of the figure, united at the
chest; and ascending from thence to the mouth,
passed through two artificial lips. Within the
cavity of the mouth was a small moveable tongue,
which by its motion at proper intervals, admitted
or intercepted the air in its passage to the flute.
The fingers, lips, and tongue derived their specific
movements from a steel cylinder turned by clockwork.
The cylinder was divided into fifteen equal
parts, which by means of pegs, pressing upon a
like number of levers, caused the other extremities
to ascend. Seven of these levers directed
the fingers, having rods and chains fixed to their
ascending extremities; which, being attached to
the fingers, made them to ascend in proportion
as the other extremity was pressed down by the
motion of the cylinders, and <i>vice versa</i>. Three of
the levers served to regulate the ingress of the
air, being so contrived as to open and shut, by
means of valves, the communication between the
lips and reservoir, so that more or less strength
might be given, and a higher or lower note produced
as occasion required.</p>

<p>The lips were directed by four similar levers;
one of which opened them to give the air a freer
passage; another contracted them; a third drew
them backward, and the fourth pushed them forward.
The remaining lever was employed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
direction of the tongue, which by its motion shut
or opened the mouth of the flute. The varied
and successive motions performed by this ingenious
androides, were regulated by a contrivance
no less simple than efficacious. The axis of the
steel cylinder or barrel was terminated by an endless
screw composed of twelve threads, above
which was placed a small arm of copper, with a
steel stud made to fit the threads of the worm,
which, by its vertical motion, was continually
pushed forward. Hence, if a lever was moved,
by a peg placed on the cylinder, in any one revolution,
it could not be moved by the same peg in
the succeeding revolution in consequence of the
lateral motion communicated by the worm. By
this means the size of the barrel was considerably
reduced; and the statue not only poured forth a
varied selection of instrumental harmony, but exhibited
all the evolutions of the most graceful
performer.</p></blockquote>

To fire two arrows in immediate succession,
it will be necessary either to attach a second
bow to the under side of the stock, which,
after discharging one arrow, may immediately
be reversed, and the second fired. Or, where a
bow of sufficient length is used, the string may
communicate the required degree of impetus to
two arrows in succession, a stud being previously

<p>The <em>break-water</em> erected by Mr. Rennie at Plymouth
is, in its results, precisely what the noble

is this: a mass of stone in blocks, of
about three feet in diameter, is thrown promiscuously
into the sea, and left to find their own base,
the extremity of which is generally about seventy
yards. This sea-wall has been carried about
eight hundred fathoms in length, and the total
expense attendant on its erection is estimated at
£1,150,000. In 1766, Mr. Smeaton also applied
loose stones to strengthen the middle piers of
London bridge, which was the means of preserving

the double roof of a house, which were covered
over, first with straw, and then with hazel faggots
about thirteen feet long; and the whole was then
pinned down with piles, which were united to each
other at their heads by pieces put across the
direction of the faggots. When this bank was
completed, Mr. Pape formed another bank, on
the top of the preceding, by filling up the interval
between the two ridges, and covering the
whole in the manner above described. All this
was accomplished in one tide, and when completed
it fully answered the purpose for which it was

former painter.</p>

<p>Pietro del Borgo, early in the fourteenth century,
constructed a very ingenious machine, which was
afterwards employed by Albert Durer for the
above purpose. It consisted of a transparent tablet,
through which the object being viewed from
a small aperture, the artist contrived to trace the
images which the various rays of light emitted
from them would make upon it.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson has also described a machine
for this purpose, the invention of which he ascribes
to Dr. Bevis. But the most simple and efficient
instrument yet discovered for large objects is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the camera obscura and camera lucida; both of
which fully answer the description given by the
noble author.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon so potent a help as these two
last mentioned inventions, a water-work is,
by many years' experience and labour, so
advantageously by me contrived, that a
child's force bringeth up, an hundred feet
high, an incredible quantity of water, even
two feet diameter. And I may boldly
call it, <em>the most stupendous work in the
whole world</em>: not only with little charge to
drain all sorts of mines, and furnish cities
with water, though never so high seated,
as well to keep them sweet, running through
several streets, and so performing the work
of scavengers, as well as furnishing the inhabitants
with sufficient water for their private
occasions: but likewise supplying the
rivers with sufficient to maintain and make
navigable from town to town, and for the
bettering of lands all the way it runs; with
many more advantageous, and yet greater effects
of profit, admiration, and consequence:
so that deservedly I deem this invention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
crown my labours, to reward my expenses,
and make my thoughts acquiesce in way of
further inventions. This making up the

<p class="center">NOTE.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The three last inventions may justly be considered
as the most important of the whole "Century,"
and when united with the 68th article, they
appear to suggest nearly all the data essential for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
the construction of a modern steam-engine. The
noble author has furnished us with what he calls
a "definition" of this engine; and although it is
written in the same vague and empirical style,
which characterises a large portion of his Inventions,
it may yet be considered as affording additional
proofs of the above important fact.</p>

<p>The Marquis's "definition" is exceedingly rare,
as the only copy known to be extant is preserved
in the British Museum.&mdash;It is printed on a single
sheet without date, and appears to have been
written for the purpose of procuring subscriptions
in aid of a Water Company, then about to be
established.</p>

<p>"A stupendous, or a water-commanding engine,
boundless for height, or quantity, requiring
no external, nor even additional help or force to
be set, or continued in motion, but what intrinsically
is afforded from its own operation, nor yet
the twentieth part thereof. And the engine consisteth
of the following particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p>'A perfect counterpoise, for what quantity
soever of water.</p>

<p>'A perfect countervail, for what height soever
it is to be brought unto.</p>

<p>'A <i>primum mobile</i>, commanding both height
and quantity, regulator-wise.</p>

<p>'A vicegerent or countervail, supplying the
place, and performing the full force of man, wind,
beast, or mill.</p>

<p>'A helm or stern, with bit and reins, wherewith
any child may guide, order, and control the
whole operation.</p>

<p>'A particular magazine for water, according
to the intended quantity, or height of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>'An aqueduct, capable of any intended quantity
or height of water.</p>

<p>'A place for the original fountain or river to
run into, and naturally of its own accord incorporate
itself with the rising water, and at the
very bottom of the aqueduct, though never so
big or high.</p>

<p>'By divine providence, and heavenly inspiration,
this is my stupendous water-commanding
engine, boundless for height and quantity.</p>

<p>'Whosoever is master of weight, is master of
force; whosoever is master of water, is master
of both: and consequently to him all forcible actions
and atchievements are easie.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>It may now be adviseable to trace the history
of the steam-engine through some of its earlier
modifications; and we shall find that, although
the present form of this stupendous machine almost
deserves the title of an invention, yet that
many steps have been taken, and much labour
and much ingenuity expended, before it was
brought to that point from which the more modern
improvements may be said to have begun.
And whilst we admire the genius of those who
have perfected the application of a mighty power,
let us not refuse the tribute of praise to those,
who first pointed out that such a power existed.</p>

<p>The first apparatus of this description, of which
any authentic account has been preserved, was
suggested by Hero of Alexandria, and consisted
of a vessel <span class="smcap">F</span> in which steam was generated by
the application of external heat. The ball <span class="smcap">G</span> was
supplied with the elastic vapour thus procured,
by means of the bent pipe <span class="smcap">E B</span>, a steam tight joint
being provided for that purpose. Two tubes
bent to a right angle at <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>, are the only
parts open to the air, and as the steam rushes
out from very minute apertures, a rotatory motion
is produced. An account of this apparatus
is preserved in Hero's <cite>Spiritalia</cite>, published by the
Jesuits in 1693; and a copy of this highly curious
work, with a Latin translation prefixed, is now
in the Library of the London Institution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>A modification of Hero's apparatus is represented
beneath:
It was constructed by Mr. Styles for the use
of the Editor in his public lectures. The circular
tube <i>a</i> is in this case supported by the upright
pillar <i>c d</i>; and the flame of alcohol in the trough <i>b</i>,
by generating high pressure steam, which rushes
from the apertures <i>e</i>, produces a rotatory motion.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Brancas's revolving apparatus, as will be seen
by reference to the diagram in the preceding page,
was still more simple than that contrived by Hero.
A copper vessel filled with water, (in the original
figure made in the form of an ornamental head,)
was furnished with a pipe <i>c</i>, through which the
steam was propelled, and striking against the
vanes of the float wheel <i>d</i>, readily gave motion
to a pestle and mortar, which was employed in
the alchemist's laboratory.</p>

<p>The only work in which a description of this
engine has been preserved, was published in 1629;
it is exceedingly rare, and the above diagram is
engraved from a copy in the possession of Major
Colby.</p>

<p>A slight examination of the principle upon
which this simple apparatus is constructed, will
shew that no very considerable force could have
been obtained; as the steam passing through the
atmosphere in its passage to the wheel, must, to
a certain extent at least, be converted into water.</p>

<p>After the publication of the work by Brancas,
more than thirty years elapsed ere the publication
of the Marquis's "Century" recalled the attention
of the scientific world to this important subject;
and this invention, which he states as having been
completely carried into effect, was evidently very
different from that of his predecessors.</p>

<p>It is said that the Marquis, while confined in
the Tower of London, was preparing some food
in his apartment, and the cover of the vessel,
having been closely fitted, was, by the expansion
of the steam, suddenly forced off and driven up
the chimney. This circumstance attracting his
attention, led him to a train of thought, which
terminated in the completion of his "water-commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
engine."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Of the Marquis's invention no
record has been preserved beyond the articles to
which we have already alluded in the present
work: and in the absence of other data, the Editor
readily introduces Professor Millington's design
for an engine on similar principles; and which,
with a few alterations, might be made available
for the purposes recommended by our author.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/page_107.jpg" width="421" height="600" alt="fourth" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>In this diagram, <i>q</i> represents a strong and close
vessel or boiler to contain water, set in brick work
like a common copper, with a fire-place <i>r</i> underneath
it, having a chimney <i>s</i>. The boiler thus constructed,
is intended to afford the means of producing
steam: and if we conceive two casks or
strong hollow vessels of any form to be placed
under the surface of the water, near the boiler,
as at <i>t</i> and <i>v</i>, and that each of these vessels has a
valve opening into it in its lower part as <i>u</i> <i>u</i>, and
two pipes <i>w</i> <i>w</i>, proceeding from the upper part of
the vessels to the top of the steam boiler <i>q</i>, while
two other pipes <i>x</i> <i>x</i> proceed from the lower parts
of these vessels into a cistern <i>y</i>, forty feet above
the level of the water; an apparatus thus constructed
will nearly form the water-commanding
engine, for if the vessels <i>t</i> and <i>v</i> are both filled
with water by the valves <i>u</i> <i>u</i>, and the cock <i>z</i> be
opened after the steam has accumulated in the
boiler, the elastic fluid thus generated will instantly
rush down into the vessel <i>t</i>, and when the surface
of the water is heated expel the whole of
its contents up the pipe <i>a x</i>, into the cistern <i>y</i>,
where it will be retained by a valve opening upwards
in any part of that pipe, as at <i>a</i>. This done,
the cock <i>z</i> must be shut, and after permitting the
steam to accumulate for a short time, that at <i>b</i>
must be opened, and the steam will rush into
the vessel <i>v</i> and perform a similar office, <i>c</i> being
the valve to prevent the return of the water.
When the steam is shut off from the vessel <i>t</i>, the
elastic fluid which had previously been introduced
to expel the water, will be condensed by the cold
media round it, and thus a vacuum will be produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
in the vessel <i>t</i>, consequently a part of the
water in which it is immersed will rush into it by
the valve <i>u</i>, and occupy the whole internal cavity,
thus putting it in a state of preparation for a second
opening of the cock <i>z</i>, by which its contents
will be again discharged into the cistern <i>y</i>, and so
of the two vessels alternately; for while <i>v</i> is emptying,
<i>t</i> will be filling, and vice versâ, which agrees
with the Marquis's account when he says, "that
the man is but to turn two cocks, that one vessel
of water being consumed, another begins to
force," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The above suggestion for an engine capable of
raising water may be still further improved by
adding a suction pipe to the valves <i>u</i> <i>u</i>, and the
pressure of the atmosphere will increase the working
power of the engine more than thirty feet:
and should a less height be required, the forcing
pipe may be shortened in a proportionate degree:
indeed this fact was attended to by the next person
who claims the honour of having invented the
steam-engine, to which it may now be adviseable
to direct the reader's attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/page_110.jpg" width="375" height="307" alt="fifth" />
</div>

<p>The engine suggested by Savery for the purpose
of raising water, consisted of a boiler <i>a</i> furnished
with a safety valve <i>v</i>. The steam-vessel <i>r</i>
was connected with the well <span class="smcap">H</span>, by a suction pipe
<i>n</i>; and when water was to be raised the vessel <i>r</i>
was filled with steam, which rushing in, soon expelled
the air: when that was completely effected,
the communication with the boiler was closed,
and the steam condensed, which diminishing its
bulk, formed a vacuous space within the vessel;
the pressure of atmosphere then operating
upon the surface of the water in the well, drove
it up the pipe. In this form of the apparatus, the
inventor was seldom able to raise water more than
thirty feet: and when a greater altitude was required,
it was effected by the impellent force of high
pressure steam. This was accomplished by the ascending
pipe <i>k</i>, which was sometimes carried sixty
feet higher than the steam-vessel <i>s</i>; and a reference
to the great expansive force of steam will
show that this operation must be attended with
considerable danger. After condensing the steam
and filling the vessel <i>r</i> with water, a new supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of steam was then introduced, which pressing on
the surface of the water, drove it up the pipe <i>k</i>;
and it will be evident that the pressure on the
internal surface of the boiler must be proportioned
to the height of the column of water thus
raised by the steam.</p>

<p>The principal objection to this form of the engine
arises from the great consumption of fuel,
a considerable portion of the caloric employed in
the generation of the steam being absorbed in
heating the new surface of cold water last raised
from the well; and where great heights are
required, there appears no mode of completely
obviating this objection. Should it, however, be
required merely to raise water about thirty feet,
there are few contrivances more economical or
better adapted for general use.</p>

<p>While speaking of Savery's apparatus it may
be adviseable to notice the very ingenious adaptation
of the same principle to the construction of
a <em>gas engine</em>, by Mr. Brown. In the latter case
a vacuum is formed by the introduction of an inflamed
jet of carburetted hydrogen gas, which
consumes the oxygen, and rarefies the nitrogen,
by the increase of temperature which ensues.
The vacuum thus produced is much more perfect
than would at first view have been supposed, from
the nature of the process resorted to by the patentee;
but the economy of employing carburetted
hydrogen gas as a substitute for condensible
vapour is still somewhat problematic.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>To more fully understand the nature of Mr.
Brown's engine, it may be better to revert to a
diagram, which will sufficiently explain its general
principles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/page_112.jpg" width="425" height="425" alt="sixth" />
</div>

<p>In the above view, the cylinders <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, are
the vessels in which a vacuum is alternately effected;
<i>g i g</i> and <i>h j h</i> are two pipes, leading into
the lower cylinders <i>x</i> <i>x</i>, shewn in the next page,
from which the water rises along those pipes to
fill the vacuum cylinders alternately. The water
thus supplied is discharged through the pipes <span class="smcap">B</span>
into the tank or trough <i>z</i>, where it falls upon the
overshot water-wheel, and, by the rotatory motion
thus produced, gives power to such machinery as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
may be connected to it. The water runs from
the wheel along a case surrounding the lower
half, into a reservoir <i>v</i>, from which the lower
cylinders <i>x</i> <i>x</i>, are alternately supplied.</p>

<p>The gas is supplied to the cylinders by the
pipes <i>k</i> <i>k</i> <i>k</i>, which must be, of course, attached to
a gasometer, or some other reservoir of gas. The
gas also passes along the small pipe <i>l</i> <i>l</i> (which
communicates also with the gasometer), and being
lighted at both ends of that pipe, is kept constantly
burning in order to ignite the gas within
the cylinders.</p>

<p>The gas being admitted along the pipe <i>k</i>, the
flame from the pipe <i>l</i> is now freely communicated
to the gas in the cylinder, through the orifice, by
the opening of the sliding valve <i>s</i>, which is raised
by the arm <i>r</i>, lifted by the rod <i>o</i> by means of the
beam.</p>

<p>The water in the reservoir <i>v</i> passing down one
of the pipes <i>w</i>, into one of the lower cylinders <i>x</i>,
causes the float <i>y</i> in that cylinder to rise, and,
pushing up the rod <i>o</i>, raises the end <i>b</i> of the
beam, which, of course, draws up with it the cap
<i>f</i>, and forces down the cap <i>e</i> of the other cylinder
<i>c</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/page_113.jpg" width="425" height="254" alt="seventh" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em>alternate</em> action of each cylinder is produced
by chains and rods, attached to a glass or
iron vessel <i>p</i>, more than half filled with mercury,
and turning upon a pivot; each end receives its
movements of elevation and depression from the
rise and fall of the projecting arms <i>q</i>, by the action
of the beam above; the mercury within
flowing to the lower end, giving an impetus, and
thus regulating the supply of gas to the cylinders,
and the movement of the slide in the trough <i>v</i>.
By this action the water from the reservoir flows
down the pipe <i>w</i>, into the vessel <i>x</i>, and produces
the elevation of the float <i>y</i> and the rod <i>n</i>, and
raises the cap <i>e</i> by the ascent of the beam at <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The motion thus produced in one part of the
machinery, operates upon the corresponding
parts on the other side, and hence a corresponding
motion is obtained: the slider in the trough <i>v</i>,
moved by the action of the mercurial tube <i>p</i>, being
removed from its position, allows the water to
fall into the other pipe <i>w</i>; and, as it ascends,
suffers the float <i>y</i> to descend, and rising into the
main cylinder, then lifts again the beam at <i>b</i>, and
its connexions, and forces down the cap <i>e</i> on the
top of the other cylinder.</p>

<p>When the vacuum is produced in the cylinders,
the air must be admitted to allow the water to be
discharged, and the caps to be raised: this is
effected by a sliding valve in the air-pipe <i>m</i> <i>m</i>,
acted upon by chains <i>t</i> <i>t</i>, attached to the floats
in the reservoir, and as motion is given to them,
the valve is made to fly backwards and forwards,
so as to allow the free admission of atmospheric
air.</p>

<p>Chains <i>u</i> <i>u</i>, with suspended weights, open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
cocks in the pipe <i>k</i> <i>k</i>, and produce the alternate
flow of the gas, and regulate and modify its supply.
In the pipes <i>g</i> <i>i</i> <i>g</i>, and <i>h</i> <i>j</i> <i>h</i>, are clacks to
prevent the return of the water, when the air is
admitted into the cylinders.</p>

<p>A piston may be worked as is above described,
with the machinery attached; but it may also be
worked in a distinct vessel so as to communicate
with several cylinders, and, consequently, several
pistons may work at the same time, the air and
vacuum valves being opened and closed by similar
means to those adapted to work the induction and
eduction valves of steam-engines.</p>

<p>The atmospheric engine comes next in order,
and its claim to practical utility is of a very early
date.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/page_115.jpg" width="450" height="502" alt="eighth" />
</div>

<p>The cylinder <i>b</i>, is in this engine placed over a
boiler <i>n</i>, and if we suppose the piston <i>p</i> made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
fit air-tight, it will be evident, that it must be driven
up by the action of the steam beneath, should
a sufficient supply of heat be applied; when this
is effected, the condensible vapour may be reduced
to its original bulk, by the introduction of water
from the cistern <i>i</i>. In the working engine however,
the ascent of the piston is effected by the
action of the lever <i>e g</i>, acting on the fulcrum <i>f</i>.
To the end <i>g</i> of this lever or working beam is
attached the pump-rod <i>h</i>, and it will be evident
that whenever that preponderates over the piston
<i>p</i>, that the latter must be drawn up. On the readmission
of the steam, a new supply of condensing
water is introduced by turning the cock <i>l</i>,
and the pressure of the atmosphere above the
piston being unbalanced by any resistance beneath,
the end <i>e</i> is again depressed, and the
pump-rod again elevated. The pipe <i>g</i> is employed
to carry off the condensing water, which
would otherwise accumulate within the cylinder;
and the small forcing pump, with its rod <i>v s</i>, supplies
the condensing cistern <i>i</i>, by the pipe <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the last century, the atmospheric
engine had made considerable progress
in the mining districts, and in 1718, the patentees
agreed to erect an engine for the owners of a
colliery, in the county of Durham, where several
hundred horses had previously been employed.
Mr. Henry Beighton, who was engaged as an
agent in this concern, materially improved the
engine by making it self-acting, and divesting it
of nearly all the complicated machinery, which
had been previously employed for that purpose.</p>

<p>A very simple and at the same time ingenious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
mode of illustrating the operations of an atmospheric
steam-engine will be found in the annexed
apparatus, suggested by Professor Brande, and
employed in his lectures at the London Institution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_117.jpg" width="250" height="414" alt="ninth" />
</div>

<p>The glass tube and bulb <i>b</i> is shewn with its
piston <i>a</i>, the rod being hollow and closed by a
screw <i>c</i>. If steam be generated by the spirit
lamp <i>d</i>, the air will speedily be expelled, and
after this is effected, the screw <i>c</i> may be closed,
and a working stroke produced by artificial condensation.</p>

<p>We come now to a new and distinct era in the
history of this important invention, and in noticing
the labours of Mr. Watt, we may almost speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of his engine as the gigantic offspring of a hand
giving birth to an automaton, no less powerful
than that of the fabled enchanters of the olden
time.</p>

<p>Mr. Watt's first great improvement in the engine
of Newcomen may be best understood by
reference to the annexed diagram, in which <i>a</i> represents
the cylinder, and <i>b</i> its plug or piston
made to fit air-tight. The pipe <i>d</i> is furnished
with a stop-cock, by means of which the elastic
vapour is occasionally admitted.&mdash;A similar pipe,
furnished with a stop-cock at <i>f</i>, passes from the
other side of the cylinder, and enters the vessel <i>g</i>;
<i>e</i> being the reservoir to contain water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_118.jpg" width="250" height="462" alt="tenth" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now suppose the piston at the bottom of
the cylinder, and steam admitted by the pipe <i>d</i>,
its expansive force will elevate the piston, and
when the air is expelled, the whole internal cavity
of the tube will be filled with condensible vapour.
On closing the steam-cock, and opening that connected
with the vessel <i>g</i>, a portion of the vapour
will immediately expand itself, and coming in
contact with the cold sides of the vessel, a portion
of its heat must be absorbed by the water
at <i>e</i>. A new portion of steam then descends,
and is also condensed, and indeed the same process
continues till the whole of the steam is drawn
from the tube. A vacuum being thus formed,
the pressure of the atmosphere will preponderate,
and the piston rod be depressed to the bottom of
the tube. On closing the stop-cock <i>f</i>, a new
supply of steam may be admitted by the other
pipe, and after raising the piston, the process of
condensation may be readily repeated.</p>

<p>The advantages that arise from this mode of
forming a vacuum are very considerable, not the
least important of which, is a saving of nearly
half the fuel.</p>

<p>In the old engine, the condensing water must
reduce the temperature of the internal surface of
the cylinder to that of the atmosphere, before a
vacuum could be produced, and when the condensing
water was applied more sparingly, the
elastic vapour remaining in the cylinder was found
to materially reduce the pressure of the air operating
above. From this it will be seen that the
great advantage of Mr. Watt's apparatus consists
in performing the condensation in a separate vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
so that the cylinder is always preserved at
the temperature of boiling water.</p>

<p>Having thus produced a vacuum without the
intervention of condensing water beneath the piston,
Mr. Watt's next improvement consisted in
closing the top of the cylinder, so that the piston-rod
worked through an air-tight hole in the centre
of the cap; and to ensure the necessary pressure
within the cylinder, steam with an elastic force
greater than that of the atmosphere was admitted
above the piston. The atmospheric engine of
Newcomen was thus converted into a steam-engine,
and its power was easily regulated.</p>

<p>A cylinder and piston constructed on the most
improved principles may now be examined.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_120.jpg" width="250" height="390" alt="eleventh" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>In the annexed diagram, the cylinder <span class="smcap">A</span> is furnished
with a steam-tight piston, the rod of which
is supposed to be connected with the working
beam. B represents the pipe which admits the
steam from the boiler, the quantity being regulated
by the throttle valve <i>c</i>, and the elastic vapour
is now passing through the box <i>d</i> <i>d</i>, so that
it enters beneath the piston. At the same instant
of time, a communication is formed through the
aperture <i>m</i> <i>n</i> to the pipe <i>p</i>, which leads to the
condenser. When the piston reaches the top of
the cylinder, the sliding bridge or valve has its
direction changed, so that the pipe <i>r</i>, and consequently
the bottom of the cylinder, is connected
with the condenser, while a passage is opened from
the pipe <i>m</i> <i>n</i> to the steam box. Thus a communication
is alternately made between the top and
bottom of the piston.</p>

<p>The slide-valve represented above is not invariably
employed in the double-acting engines, and
we frequently find the annexed contrivance resorted
to, in some of the best engines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/page_121.jpg" width="300" height="305" alt="twelfth" />
</div>

<p>The pipe 14 represents the passage to the cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and a communication is now opened with
the steam chamber <i>g</i>. The raised valve is perforated
and a similar valve beneath closed by the
rod which passes through it. On closing the
valve <i>g</i>, the lower valve <i>h</i> is opened, and a free
passage between the condensing pipe beneath and
the upper part of the cylinder is the result. If
we now suppose a similar double valve placed at
the bottom of the cylinder, it will easily be seen
that an effect similar to that described in the
sliding valve will be produced.</p>

<p>The speed of the engine is regulated by a very
ingenious contrivance introduced by Mr. Watt,
called the <em>governor</em>, and represented beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_122.jpg" width="250" height="298" alt="thirteenth" />
</div>

<p>The balls <i>i</i> <i>i</i> are supported by the bent levers
<i>h</i> <i>f</i>, and as they are made to revolve with the fly
wheel axis, by means of a band passing round the
pulley <i>c</i>, any increase in the speed of the engine
will cause the balls to diverge. The moment this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
takes place, the shorter arm of the lever <i>n</i> is depressed,
and as the extremity <i>l</i> is connected with
the steam-pipe by the throttle valve, the supply
of steam must of necessity be diminished, and
the speed of the engine reduced.</p>

<p>As the working power of the engine depends
very materially on the accurate fitting of the piston,
it may be adviseable to examine some of the
modes of effecting this important object.</p>

<p>Mr. Smeaton, who greatly improved the atmospheric
engine, coated the under side of the
piston with elm or beech planks about two inches
thick; the wooden bottom being screwed to the
iron with a double thickness of flannel and tar, to
exclude the air between the iron and the wood.
By the adoption of this improvement, its property
of conducting heat was reduced, and the wood
having been previously jointed, with the grain
radiating in all directions from the centre, was
not liable to expand by the heated steam. This
piston was kept air-tight by a small stream of
water continually falling on its upper surface;
but in Mr. Watt's engine he was compelled to
make the piston fit tight without any other media
than the oil that was employed to lubricate it.</p>

<p>The piston is now cast with a projecting rim
at bottom, which is fitted as accurately as possible;
the part above the rim being about four
inches less than the cylinder, thus leaving a circular
groove for the hemp which forms the packing.
To keep this in its place, a lid or cover is
put over the top of the piston, with a projection
which enters into the circular groove for the
packing, and pressing upon it, the plate is forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
down by screws, which work into the body
of the piston. By this means the packing is
made to fill the internal part of the cylinder with
tolerable accuracy, and thus prevents for a time
any steam passing between the piston and the
cylinder. When, however, by continued working,
the packing ceases to fit, it occasions a waste of
steam, to remedy which, the cylinder cap must be
removed, and as this is attended with a considerable
degree of trouble to the engine-man, it is
seldom attended to till a considerable loss of
power has arisen. There are two improvements
on the piston, by which this inconvenience is to a
certain extent obviated.</p>

<p>In the first, by Mr. Woolfs, each of the screws
is furnished with a wheel or nut, and these are
all connected together by means of a central
wheel, working loose upon the piston-rod in such
a manner, that if any one of the screws be turned,
a similar motion is given to the remainder.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_124.jpg" width="250" height="245" alt="fourteenth" />
</div>

<p>In a piston thus constructed, there is little difficulty
in drawing down the packing, by applying
a key to the square head of the projecting screw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
employed to communicate with the rest: the
key-hole being afterwards closed by a cap.</p>

<p>The second contrivance is by Mr. Barton, a
diagram of which, accompanied by a piston as it
is usually constructed, is shewn beneath.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/page_125.jpg" width="400" height="177" alt="fifteenth" />
</div>

<p>In the first piston, the screws <i>i</i> <i>i</i> are made to
compress the packing <i>h</i> <i>h</i>, by acting upon the
plate <i>n</i> <i>n</i>, the piston-rod <i>r</i> being firmly attached
by the nut <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>In one of the modifications of <i>Barton's piston</i>,
on the contrary, the packing is dispensed with, as
the flexible springs <i>t</i> <i>t</i> <i>t</i> press upon the wedges
<i>c</i> <i>c</i> <i>c</i>, and expand the intermediate plates. A
break-joint is readily formed, by making the series
of plates double; the second set of plates
falling upon the spaces which occur between the
first row.</p>

<p>The action of the <em>high pressure</em> engine depends
upon the great elastic force acquired by steam,
when exposed to the action of heat at very high
temperatures.&mdash;It may indeed be considered as a
return to the principle of Brancas and the Marquis
of Worcester, as in this engine no condensing
water is necessary; and it acts merely by the
elastic or repellant force of steam. In the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
pressure engine, the condenser is taken away;
and the steam, instead of being converted into
water by artificial cold in a close vessel, is allowed
to escape into the atmosphere from one side of
the piston, while it is acting forcibly on the other.</p>

<p>The advantages of the high pressure engine
over that used with a condenser, are cheapness in
construction, and a saving of the whole expense
attendant on procuring a sufficient supply of condensing
water, which in some cases is an object
of considerable importance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_126.jpg" width="250" height="316" alt="sixteenth" />
</div>

<p>In the annexed section, the piston <i>B</i> passes
through an air-tight stuffing box, and the steam
is entering beneath it, by the four-way cock <i>E</i>.
If we now suppose the piston at the top of the
cylinder, a new arrangement of the communicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pipe takes place, as the steam which was beneath
escapes, while a fresh supply enters above. The
four-way cock may be best explained by a section
in the opposite direction. Two pipes are seen at
the lower extremity of the cock, which communicate
with the upper and under sides of the piston.
The aperture <i>D</i> opens to the air, while the pipe
<i>C</i> serves for the admission of steam from the
boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/page_127.jpg" width="300" height="391" alt="seventeenth" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now to notice the double cylinder engine
constructed by Woolfs, which will be found,
by reference to the diagram in the preceding page,
to consist of a high pressure cylinder, connected
with a condensing apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> represent the two cylinders, in the
larger of which the steam is allowed to expand
itself, after passing from the high pressure cylinder
<span class="smcap">B</span>. The steam, which in the first instance is
of considerable elasticity, is admitted to the cylinder
<span class="smcap">B</span>, by the tube and valve <span class="smcap">E</span>, and entering
the cylinder above its piston, impels it to the
bottom. When this is effected, a communication
is opened between the upper part of the cylinder
<span class="smcap">B</span>, and the under side of the cylinder <span class="smcap">A</span>. The
communication between the cylinder <span class="smcap">B</span> and the
steam-pipe <span class="smcap">E</span>, is now reversed, and the steam is
made to press on the under side of the piston <span class="smcap">B</span>,
a communication being at the same time formed
between the upper part of the cylinder <span class="smcap">A</span>, and the
pipe leading to the condenser which is seen beneath.
So that if we suppose the two pistons
connected by means of their rods with one end
of an ordinary working beam, the upward and
downward strokes of each will be performed at
the same time. We have hitherto considered
the steam as passing direct from the boiler to the
cylinder <span class="smcap">B</span>; this, however, is in reality effected by
a more circuitous route, as it is in the first instance
admitted to the steam-case of the larger cylinder
by the pipe <span class="smcap">C</span>, and passing round a similar case,
encircling the cylinder <span class="smcap">B</span>, it is then made to enter
at <span class="smcap">E</span>. The pipe at <span class="smcap">D</span> is merely intended to form
a communication for carrying back to the boiler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
any water that may be produced by condensation
in the steam-case, before the engine arrives at a
proper temperature for working.</p>

<p>Having thus briefly examined the nature of
Mr. Woolf's engine, it may now be advisable to
revert to the boiler, by which he proposes to generate
steam of sufficient elasticity for the use of
the small cylinder, which requires elastic vapour
of great expansive force. The boiler, represented
by the diagram beneath, consists of a series of
tubes, of cast-iron, connected by screw-bolts with
the under side of a larger vessel <span class="smcap">A A</span>, communicating
with the engine. The upper boiler is furnished
with four, and in some cases, with five
apertures; the first of which is intended for the
admission of water, to supply the waste which
continually arises from evaporation. The safety
valves, man-hole, and water-pipe are also shewn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/page_129.jpg" width="350" height="259" alt="eighteenth" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The mode of setting this boiler is also of considerable
importance, as it is advisable to give a
long and waving course to the chimney.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/page_130a.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="nineteenth" />
</div>

<p>A A still represents the principal boiler, while
the figures 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. indicate the passage of
the flame and heated air; a section of the chimney
being shewn at <span class="smcap">O</span>.</p>

<p>The steel-yard safety-valve which was employed
in all the early engines is simple, and the nature
of its construction may readily be understood.
A represents a portion of the upper part of the
boiler; <span class="smcap">B</span> the safety-valve or plug made to fit air-tight
on the valve-seat beneath; <span class="smcap">C</span> the lever
working on its axis at <span class="smcap">D</span>, and furnished with a
moveable weight <span class="smcap">E</span>, adjusted to balance the pressure
of steam within the boiler.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/page_130b.jpg" width="250" height="177" alt="twentieth" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>When steam of great elasticity is required, the
weight is placed at the extremity of the lever,
and as such, acts with greater force on the safety-valve,
than when removed to a point nearer to
the axis on which it revolves: so that should <em>low</em>
pressure steam, or that which has a less expansive
force, be required, it will only be necessary
to remove it nearer towards the axis on which it
turns.</p>

<p>The lever and balance-ball safety valve already
described, appear but little calculated for
those engines in which high pressure steam is
employed, as the engine-man, in an over anxious
zeal for the full performance of the machinery
confided to his care, has been frequently known
to increase the internal pressure of a large boiler
many thousand pounds beyond the resistance to
which it was originally proved. To prevent a
recurrence of those accidents, which first drew
the attention of the legislature to this important
part of the engine, it appears advisable to inclose
the safety-valve in an iron case, of which a section
is annexed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/page_131.jpg" width="300" height="322" alt="twentyfirst" />
</div>

<p>The valve <i>B</i> in this case rests upon a conical
seat in the boiler <i>A</i>, and is furnished with a series
of small moveable plates lettered <i>c</i>, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
employed to increase or diminish the entire weight
of the safety-valve, the whole being covered by
the box <i>D</i>; and as this is pierced with a number
of small holes, the steam readily escapes when the
expansive force exceeds the resistance offered by
the loaded valve.</p>

<p>The patent <em>revolving wheel</em> invented by Mr.
Masterman, appears to promise the best results
of any rotatory engine yet invented, the friction
being much less than in any other apparatus in
which steam is employed as a prime mover. In
this engine, Mr. Masterman proposes to employ
water, or the fluid metal mercury as the immediate
agent, which he effects by inclosing it in the
tubular rim of a large wheel, furnished with valves
opening in one direction. This wheel, as is shewn
in the opposite diagram, is made to revolve on a
hollow axis connected with the steam boiler. The
arms or spokes which radiate from the axis are
also hollow; and on the admission of steam from
the boiler, it is conducted through the arm immediately
opposite, and entering the rim of the wheel,
comes in contact with, and presses against the
column of water beneath and the closed valve
above the arm. The water being previously
heated to the boiling point, no condensation ensues,
but the whole weight of water, which was
previously balanced in two columns of equal
height, is driven, by the pressure of the steam, to
the side opposite to that at which the elastic
vapour entered, and that side of the wheel will
necessarily preponderate. If this process be repeated,
the steam being allowed to blow through
each radiating arm in succession, a continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
rotatory motion will be produced. Should it be
advisable to employ steam of less elasticity, a
condenser may be added, and that too without
materially increasing the expense.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/page_133.jpg" width="400" height="416" alt="twentysecond" />
</div>

<p>The application of steam-engines to the <em>propelling</em>
of <em>carriages</em> on the public road, has hitherto
been considered as a refinement in mechanics,
rather to be wished for than a matter of reasonable
expectation. The <em>locomotive</em> engine was first
employed for this purpose by Messrs. Trevithick
and Vivian, in 1802; and it found a ready introduction
to the mining districts where rail-roads
are general. In some cases, five, six, and even
ten waggons laden with coal are dragged up an
inclined plane by means of these vehicles; and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
course impelled by a high pressure engine, from
the utter impossibility of carrying condensing
water in a moveable vehicle.</p>

<p>An engine of four horses' power, employed by
Mr. Blenkinsop, impelled a carriage lightly loaded
on a rail-road at the rate of ten miles an hour,
and when connected with thirty coal waggons,
each weighing more than three tons, its average
rate was about one-third of that pace.</p>

<p>When the locomotive engine was first tried, it
was found difficult to produce a sufficient degree
of re-action between the wheels and the tract
road; so that the wheels turned round without
propelling the vehicle. This inconvenience was,
however, obviated by Mr. Blenkinsop, who, when
he adopted the locomotive engine, took up the
common rails, on one side of the whole length of
the road, and replaced them by a series of racks,
or rails, furnished with large teeth. The impelling
wheel of the engine was made to act in these
teeth, so that it continued to work in a rack
which insured a sufficient degree of re-action.</p>

<p>From the great weight of an ordinary <em>locomotive
engine</em> as well as the construction of its impelling
wheel, it must be evident that the employment of
this species of prime mover on the public roads
would be in the highest degree destructive; and
as such that its use will for some years to come
be partially confined to the mining districts, in
which the greatest facilities are offered for its
general adoption. Indeed, we find in one neighbourhood
alone, and within a space of less than
thirty square miles, more than twenty miles of
road admirably adapted for this species of conveyance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and it is a well known fact, that there
are many situations in which iron rail-roads
might be advantageously employed, in which it
would be quite impossible to open a navigable
canal. In illustration of the above fact, it may be
proper to state, that a company, with a large
capital, is now forming for the express purpose
of facilitating the conveyance of goods by locomotive
engines.</p>

<p>The mode of applying the steam-engine to the
purposes of navigation is equally simple with its
employment in our manufactures.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that the <em>steam-boat</em> is
of very recent invention; on the contrary, however,
the possibility of employing steam as a prime
mover in the propelling of vessels was suggested
as far back as the reign of Charles I.</p>

<p>In one of the old tracts preserved in the library
of the London Institution there is a very curious
representation of a steam-boat, constructed by an
engineer of the name of Hulls. And this individual,
now so little known, was undoubtedly the
first who applied a steam-engine to the purpose
of navigation.</p>

<p>To impel a vessel by this means, two paddle
wheels, like those used in an under-shot water-wheel,
are connected by means of a long axis and
crank, with the working beam of the steam-engine;
and if this motion is not found sufficiently
rapid, a wheel and pinion are added, which,
although it <em>decreases</em> the effective power of the
engine, yet <em>increases</em> the velocity of the paddle
wheels.</p>

<p>To illustrate the great advantages possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
by the steam-engine, even in its rudest state,
over every other species of prime mover yet enumerated,
it may now be advisable to examine its
effective force when employed in the working of
pumps. It has been found that one hundred
weight of coals burned in an engine on the old
construction, would raise at least <em>twenty thousand
cubic feet</em> of water twenty-four feet high; an engine
with a twenty-four inch cylinder doing the
work of <em>seventy four horses</em>. An engine on Capt.
Savery's plan, constructed by Mr. Keir, has been
found to raise nearly <em>three millions</em> of pounds of
water, and Mr. Watt's engine, upwards of <em>thirty
millions</em> of pounds the same height.</p>

<p>To the mining interests this valuable present
of science to the arts has been peculiarly acceptable;
as a large portion of our now most productive
mineral districts must long ere this have
been abandoned, had not the steam-engine been
employed as an active auxiliary in those stupendous
works. In the draining of fens and
marsh lands, this machine is in the highest degree
valuable; and in England, particularly, it might
be rendered still more generally useful. In
practice it has been ascertained that an engine of
six-horse power will drain more than eight thousand
acres, raising the water six feet in height;
whilst the cost of an engine for this species of
work, including the pumps, will not exceed seven
hundred pounds. This is more than ten windmills
could perform, at an annual expenditure of
several hundred pounds; while, in the former
case, the outgoings will not exceed one hundred
and fifty pounds per annum. To the mariner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
also, the steam-engine offers advantages of a no
less important and novel nature than those which
have already been described. By its use he is
enabled to traverse the waters both against wind
and tide, with nearly as much certainty, and, as
the machinery is now constructed, with much less
danger, than by the most eligible road conveyance.
It too frequently, however, happens that
the faults of any new invention are unjustly magnified,
while its real advantages are seldom duly
appreciated; and this axiom has been fully verified,
in the clamour so unjustly raised against the
application of the steam-engine to nautical purposes.
Accidents are now, however, but of rare
occurrence; and it is more than probable, that
the great improvements which have been made
in the boiler and safety-valve will effectually secure
these parts of the engine from a recurrence
of such tremendous explosions as characterised
the first introduction of steam navigation. And,
lastly, the political economist must hail with the
most heartfelt gratification, the introduction of so
able and efficient a substitute for animal labour
as the steam-engine. For it has been calculated
that there are at least ten thousand of these machines
at the present time at work in Great
Britain, performing a labour more than equal to
that of two hundred thousand horses, which, if
fed in the ordinary way, would require above one
million acres of land for subsistence; and this is
capable of supplying the necessaries of life to more
than fifteen hundred thousand human beings.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>An ingenious foreigner, who lately visited
England, has published an estimate of the mechanical
force set in action by the steam-engines
of this country.</p>

<p>He supposes that the <em>great pyramid</em> of Egypt
required for its erection the labour of more than
10,000 men for 20 years:&mdash;but if it were required
again to raise the stones from the quarries,
and place them at their present height, the action
of the steam-engines of England, which are managed
at most by 36,000 men, would be sufficient
to produce the same effect in 18 hours.</p>

who in every point in which Charles was concerned,

on the king's character, and whose gross partiality in
this particular instance we shall hereafter more fully
notice, has even questioned the propriety of the Marquis's
assuming the title of Earl of Glamorgan. To
support this argument, it is said that his Majesty
ordered Secretary Nicholas to acquaint the Earl of
Ormonde, "that, the patent for making Lord Herbert
Earl of Glamorgan had never passed the great seal;"
and the apologist for Charles, anxious to make the most
of this equivocation in the king, adduces it as an objection
to the authenticity of the Irish commission.
Sandford, however, who in an intimate acquaintance
with the history of the royal grants was surpassed by
none, says, "that there now remains in the signet office
a bill, under the royal sign manual at Oxford, if a
patent did not thereupon pass the great seal, in order
to his creation into the honour of Earl of Glamorgan."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> There is scarcely to be found on record, a more
enthusiastic instance of loyalty and self-devotion than
was exhibited by his lordship on this occasion; for with
the damning proofs which he then possessed of his
Majesty's complete concurrence and participation in
the whole matter, there could not for an instant have
been a doubt of his own honourable acquittal. There
was also a certain assurance of procuring the favour of
the Parliament: who required nothing more than these
documents to colour the proceedings they were then
meditating, and which, indeed, afterwards formed one
of the principal charges against this ill-fated monarch.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Lord Orford describes this bill to have passed on
the "simple affirmation of the discovery that he (the
Marquis) had made;" but his lordship's palpable want
of candour in this statement will be apparent when it
is known that there were no less than seven meetings
of committees on the subject, composed of some of the
most learned men in the house, who, after considerable
amendments, finally passed it on the 12th of May.&mdash;Vide,

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A popular author, to one of whose mistatements
we alluded in a preceding note, describes the Marquis
as "a fantastic projector," and his "Century as an
amazing piece of folly." Having however, in the notes
appended to this work, fully demonstrated not only
the practicability of applying the major part of the inventions
there described, but the absolute application
of many of them, though under other names, to some
of the most useful purposes of life; we shall leave it to
the public to judge, whether the man who first discovered
a mode of applying steam as a mechanical agent,
an invention alone sufficient to immortalize the age in
which he lived, deserves the name of a fantastic projector.

The second edition of the "Century" was published
in 1746; the third in 1767: while the fourth, which
may be considered as the best edition, is a reprint from
the first, and is furnished with an appendix "containing
an Historical Account of the Fire Engine for Raising
Water." It is dated Kyo, near Lancaster, June 18,
1778. The fifth is a reprint from the Glasgow copy,
"by W. Bailey, Proprietor of the Speaking Figure,
now showing, by permission of the Right Hon. the
Lord Mayor, at No. 42, within Bishopsgate," 1786.
The sixth edition was confined to 100 copies, and
dated London 1813.</p></div>
